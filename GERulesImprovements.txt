REDUCED NUMBER OF POINT TYPES
-----------------------------
Ships and Terrain only produce and use 3 types of points: Energy, Supply, and Economy.
Economy Points can be used as Energy or Supply and will be used to replace other point
types in the game - it can be used to repair/heal, will replace Research.
Standard Heavy Weapons will use Supply Points.

CONSOLIDATE WEAPONS FIRE
------------------------
Not sure which way would be the best, but would like to simply weapons fire.
Option 1) Tally all weapons fire into Fleet Targeted, Phaser, and Heavy Weapons totals. Then begin
assigning damage to targets one by one. The source of the damage won't matter, so 

Option 2) Each Unit must fire all of its weapons at a single target. Only Heavy Weapons can still
affect a Terrain; to make up for this when a unit fires on a Terrain with a Base or based they will
target the whichever Base they want first, then damage will "splash" to the next Base on the stack, 
then when all Bases are eliminated any remaining Heavy Weapons damage will splash to the Terrain
itself.


CONSOLIDATE DAMAGE TYPES
------------------------
Only two types of damage exist - Structural and Shield.
No more "Card Damage."
No more unrepairable damage.
No more special repair restrictions.



TECHNOLOGY RULES
----------------
Completely remove the idea of Adapted Technology; it's too convoluted and adds little to the game. 

Secret Technology can only be used by the Empire

Restricted Technology can be used by other empires if they have a card that allow the use of Foreign Technology.
