<p>This document is a superset of information presented in the first two issues 
of <i>Galactic Fire Magazine</i>. 
</p><h2 align="center"><a name="playing">Playing Cards</a></h2>
<p><b>How are cards played (engaged or disengaged):</b> Cards with an engagement 
cost are played disengaged. Cards without an engagement cost are played engaged. 

</p><p>Two exceptions are abilities and non-passive equipment. These are always 
played disengaged when being played to a disengaged card. 
</p><p>Anything that affects the engagement cost of cards in the fleet has no effect 
on how that card is played. Cards which specify that their engagement cost 
varies by location (or other effect) are played either engaged or disengaged 
based on the engagement cost at the location (or other effect) to which they are 
being played. 
</p><p><b>Where are cards played:</b> Where cards are played is determined by their 
type (ships are played to the fleet or to terrain in the fleet, bases are only 
played to terrain in the fleet, etc.). Some types, however, determine where they 
are played by what is on the card. Cards affecting one or more cards are played 
to or against the affected card or cards. Cards affecting things other than 
cards (weapons fire, opponents' card plays, etc.) are played to the owning 
player's fleet. 
</p><p><b>When can cards be played:</b> Cards are played during your turn during 
either card play phase (Play Cards Phase A or Play Cards Phase B). Certain cards 
exempt themselves from this rule by stating during which phase they are played 
(Example: "Played during the Weapons Fire Phase" or "May be played during the 
Allocation Phase"). In the first example, the card must be played during the 
Weapons Fire Phase. In the second example, the option is given to play the card 
during the Allocation Phase. It may still be played during a card play phase if 
desired. 
</p><p>Cards with an "R/" before their card type may be played as a reaction to an 
opponent's action as long as the card performs a card action (a function stated 
on the card) or states some rule which is used when played. Cards that state "as 
a reaction," in their text must be in play to be used (unless the card has an 
"R/" before their card type). The following are opponent actions to which you 
may react: Point Allocation, a card being played or placed/moved into play, a 
card action, weapons fire, and discarding during the discard phase. Keep in 
mind, even though drawing cards is not on the list, you can react to a card 
action used to draw cards, such as a cyber mage or quartermaster. See "When do 
cards perform their action" under "Card Actions". 
</p><p><b>Turn 1 and 2 Restrictions:</b> Turn 2 begins for all players as soon as 
the first player has begun his/her second turn. Turn 3 begins for each player as 
he/she begins his/her third turn. 
</p><h2 align="center"><a name="CardActions">Card Actions</a></h2>
<p><b>When do cards perform their action(s):</b> Engaged cards perform their 
actions during their controller's turn during a card play phase (either Play 
Cards Phase A or B). Example: An Evil Temple will destroy the opponent's crew as 
a card action during the temple controller's turn. The exceptions to this are as 
follows. 
</p><p>Cards played in reaction mode act when played (during any phase or turn). 
They then may perform their actions during their controller's following and 
subsequent turn. 
</p><p>Cards which state "as a reaction," may only perform such actions as a 
reaction to an opponent's action (during any phase of any player's turn). Such 
cards must be in play to perform their action and require an "R/" to be played 
in reaction mode. 
</p><p>Some cards act during a different phase as appropriate. A C4 Temporal 
Mechanic affects the controller's card draw and therefore acts during the Draw 
Cards Phase. Ships firing weapons may only do so during the Weapons Fire Phase. 
</p><p>Cards played in reaction mode may only fire weapons if played during a 
Weapons Fire Phase. 
</p><p>Disengaged cards may not perform any actions. Rules on disengaged cards do 
not apply unless they are strictly self-affecting. Rules on an ability card 
disengaged due to the crew being disengaged are considered self-affecting if 
they affect either the ability or the card on which the ability is played. This 
is to say that a disengaged B4 Border Station will not prevent other bases from 
being the target of weapons fire, because rules on disengaged cards do not 
affect other cards. However, a disengaged T3 Crystal Planet (disengaged due to 
an invasion, for example) is still immune to weapons fire because that rule only 
affects the card itself. 
</p><p>If a card states that another card may not be used or may not function, the 
affected card is treated as if it was disengaged. The card is not, however, 
actually disengaged unless the effect states that it disengages the card. 
</p><p><b>How many times may cards perform their functions:</b> All engaged cards 
may perform their action(s) once per turn. Disengaged cards may not perform any 
actions. 
</p><p>Some cards (such as an A6 Promotion, or a C8 Spiritual Leader) allow certain 
cards to perform a function twice. If two such cards are applied to the same 
card, the card would be able to perform two separate functions twice each or a 
single function three times. Please note that weapons fire is not considered a 
function. 
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="Various">Various Subjects:</a></h2>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Ability Cards:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Ability cards are played to crew in your fleet unless the ability says 
  otherwise. 
  </dd><dt><b>Activated:</b> 
  </dt><dd>A card that is activated against another card is affecting that card 
  without needing to move against that card. A tractor beam or mine is activated 
  against a ship. It is not considered played against the ship. 
  </dd><dt><b>Allocation Phase:</b> 
  </dt><dd>The Allocation Phase and the Engagement Phase are separate phases. Cards 
  which produce points or modify the production of points do so if they will be 
  engaged during the Engagement Phase. If they will not be engaged, they do not 
  produce or modify points during the Allocation Phase. This allows a card to 
  use its own point modification to pay its own engagement cost. Essentially, at 
  the end of the Engagement Phase, your output must be sufficient to pay for the 
  engagement cost of all cards engaged in the fleet. If a player wishes to 
  modify your output with reaction cards, he may do so while you are allocating 
  or applying points. You must then recheck your points. 
  <p>When you are done allocating points, declare what ship systems are loaded 
  and what excess points are available (if you plan on applying them). Then 
  apply the points. Points may only be applied to each opponent card once during 
  the Allocation Phase. If you are required to recheck your point output and 
  reallocate, you may reallocate the same number of points (or fewer) to an 
  opponent card. You may not use this opportunity to apply more points. Reacting 
  to point output early in the phase will solve most problems. 
  </p><p>Cards with durations advance in duration at the beginning of the Allocation 
  Phase. Cards with durations that affect point output perform their point 
  output or modification to point output before being discarded. </p>
  </dd><dt><b>Armor Systems:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Armor systems are a special ship system and are not shields or EMF (and 
  are compatible with either). An armor system may be activated any time damage 
  is being applied to the structure of a card with an armor system. They may not 
  be activated if the damage being applied does not penetrate the unit's 
  defenses (shields or EMF). They may not be activated against damage which 
  states that it is structural (such as a boarding party attack). Only normal 
  (not direct structural) damage which reaches the structure (causing structural 
  damage) may be prevented by the use of an armor system. 
  <p>An armor system may only be activated once against each source of damage. A 
  single weapons volley from multiple sources is considered one source of 
  damage. Armor systems function, regardless of whether the unit is engaged or 
  disengaged. Every time an armor system is activated, it prevents an amount of 
  damage from being applied to the structure equal to its current strength. In 
  doing this, the system loses a single point of strength. Armor systems may not 
  be repaired. </p>
  </dd><dt><b>Auctions:</b> 
  </dt><dd>When a card requires an auction of points (usually economy), players may 
  bid an amount of points up to the amount they would produce as if it were 
  currently their Allocation Phase. They may not include any point modification 
  from cards not currently engaged. They may not use the point output of cards 
  prevented from producing points (even if they will be able to produce points 
  by their next Allocation Phase). 
  <p>The winner of the auction has his bid subtracted from his point output of 
  his next Allocation Phase. If all points bid are not paid (possibly due to 
  some effect after the auction), remaining points due must be paid on his 
  following Allocation Phase. Any cards which consume points receive their 
  points before any debt is paid. Any current debt must be taken into account if 
  another auction is held. </p>
  </dd><dt><b>Bases:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Bases can fire at any standard target (including other bases or terrain). 
  They may not fire at a Sector HQ or Psy Network. Bases are not designated as 
  ground or orbital. Any references to orbiting bases simply refers to bases on 
  the terrain, unless the card states to see the illustration. For these cases, 
  if you see the base floating in space, it is orbital; otherwise, it is not. 
  </dd><dt><b>Basis of a stack:</b> 
  </dt><dd>A card is considered the basis of a stack any time there is one or more 
  cards played to or against it. Any card with the phrase "may not be played to 
  the basis of a stack" will be voided if the card becomes the basis of a stack 
  before its effects are resolved. 
  </dd><dt><b>Bids:</b> 
  </dt><dd>See "Auctions" in this section for the rules for bidding points. 
  </dd><dt><b>Card Damage:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Card damage is any damage from a source other than weapons fire. The 
  important distinction between the two types of damage is that card damage that 
  is applied to the structure of terrain may not be repaired by repair points 
  unless the source of these points states they may be used to repair card 
  damage. Please note that only cards which specifically state they damage 
  terrain may apply card damage to the structure of terrain. 
  </dd><dt><b>Card Name:</b> 
  </dt><dd>The title of a card includes the name above the illustration and below the 
  illustration. The T5 Planet - Candor II is not considered the same identical 
  card as the T5 Planet - Zambarez Planet. 
  </dd><dt><b>Card Strength:</b> 
  </dt><dd>A card's strength is the number located in the upper left corner of the 
  card. When there are two numbers separated by a slash, the first is the fleet 
  strength (the card's strength when not in the time origin) and the second is 
  the origin strength. Any card with a split strength goes to the time origin 
  when discarded from the fleet. Damage applied to the structure of a card does 
  not affect its strength, only its current strength (see "Current Strength" in 
  this section). Only cards that state they affect the strength of a card modify 
  a card's strength. 
  </dd><dt><b>Combined:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Whenever two or more cards become combined, they are treated as one card 
  of the appropriate type. The strengths of the two cards are added to determine 
  the strength of the combined card. Any shields and weapons are considered 
  added together, forming one set of weapons and one shield. The point output is 
  combined (and therefore may be modified as a whole). Functions and rules are 
  not combined. Immunities only apply to the points contributed by the immune 
  card. The cards are considered two different cards, with one card being played 
  to the other for the purposes of cards that affect a single card or stack of 
  cards. This is to say, a T6 Vorn with a T4 White Dwarf is 1 terrain for 
  terrain affecting cards such as O7 Interplanetary Conflict, but is a T4 on a 
  T6 for cards such as R/L8 Vacuum Effect. 
  <p>Cards are only combined while in play. Combined cards which are moved to 
  the reserve fleet, the hand, or the Discard Pile will become separate cards. 
  As an example, when an S1 Patrol Ship combined with an S7 Patrol Ship Courier 
  is destroyed, the patrol ship would be returned to the hand and the courier 
  would be discarded. 
  </p><p>When two cards are combined, any damage applied to either card is 
  considered damage applied to the combined cards. The type of damage does not 
  change. Structural damage must remain structural (the same goes for shield 
  damage). When combined cards are separated, the damage may be divided between 
  the two. However, structural damage may not be applied to either card in 
  excess of its strength (the same applies to shield damage). 
  </p><p>Combined cards require a command slot based on a single card of the 
  combined strength. A strength six ship (requiring one command slot) combined 
  with a strength two ship (requiring one half of a command slot) becomes a 
  strength eight ship (requiring one command slot). 
  </p><p>If an effect (certain fields) allows parts of a combined card to be damaged 
  separately, any currently existing damage must be divided (as if the parts 
  were separating). </p>
  </dd><dt><b>Command Points/Slots:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Like all points, command points are only generated during the Allocation 
  Phase. These points are converted into command slots for any cards in play 
  which consume a command slot (or half of a slot). Any excess points not needed 
  for command slots may be used to engage cards requiring a command point to 
  engage (time knights). Once this is done, any unused points are converted into 
  command slots. Points not used during the Allocation Phase are lost, but 
  command points not used are always turned into command slots. Command slots 
  last one complete turn (or until occupied). 
  <p>If you do not generate enough command points to provide a command slot for 
  each card requiring a command slot in play in your fleet (most units and all 
  psys), there is no effect on your cards currently in play. This will prevent 
  you from engaging cards which require a command point to engage (time knights) 
  and also prevents cards which require a command slot from being played. 
  </p><p>If a card consuming a command slot is discarded, the slot is only free to 
  use if you were not over your command limit. Any cards in play requiring a 
  command slot that did not receive one during your last Allocation Phase 
  immediately fill any vacant slots. 
  </p><p>Units in the time origin require a command slot based on their origin 
  strength. </p>
  </dd><dt><b>Complete Turn:</b> 
  </dt><dd>A complete turn is from the beginning of your Allocation Phase to the 
  beginning of your next Allocation Phase. A turn is the same as a complete 
  turn. A turn is relative to each player. It is possible for one player to be 
  on his third complete turn while another player is still in the middle of his 
  second turn. 
  <p>Cards with durations are considered to have been in play one turn during 
  their controller's Allocation Phase. This is regardless of which player turn 
  on which the card is played. An R/S1 Ship from the Future, when played as a 
  reaction during an opponent's Weapons Fire Phase, is discarded at the 
  beginning of the ship controller's Allocation Phase. This is one complete 
  turn. </p>
  </dd><dt><b>Control:</b> 
  </dt><dd>You must have any required command slot available before you may control a 
  card requiring a command slot. When control is established on such a card, it 
  is no longer using a command slot in the original controller's fleet. The 
  location of the card does not change. Filarians are an exception to this. It 
  is still in the fleet of the person who played the card being a controlled. 
  Again, Filarians are an exception to this. It will only protect the Sector HQ 
  or Psy Network of the controlling player (as appropriate). 
  <p>The controlling player pays any engagement costs of a controlled card 
  during their Allocation Phase. He uses any functions of the card during his 
  own turn (unless the card functions otherwise). </p>
  </dd><dt><b>Current Strength:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Current strength is structural strength less any damage applied to the 
  structure. Only when a card uses the term "current strength" is it referring 
  to the remaining strength points. Some of the cards that refer to current 
  strength are the M8 Ship Collector and the O9 Ship Collision. 
  </dd><dt><b>Cyber Card:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Any card with cyber in its name is a cyber card. Also any card treated as 
  cyber is a cyber card. Example: A C5 Psyber Mage which states that it is 
  considered a cyber mage is a cyber card. 
  </dd><dt><b>Discarded After Use:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Any card which is discarded after use stays in play until all functions 
  that the card is going to perform have been completed. 
  </dd><dt><b>Dragons (D):</b> 
  </dt><dd>Dragons are treated as ships for the purpose of card interaction. However, 
  they are a separate category for the purpose of the deck stocking rules. Minor 
  empire dragons must be supported by four main empire ships and/or dragons 
  unless being used as a main empire. 
  <p>Dragons may not have equipment, crew or occurrence cards played to or 
  against them. Such cards can still affect them. A mine card can damage a 
  dragon. A boarding party can perform a there-and-back mission to the dragon. 
  An R/O5 Volatile Terrain is capable of damaging a dragon which damaged the 
  terrain. </p>
  </dd><dt><b>EMF:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Electromagnetic field (EMF) defense is a system of defense used by the 
  Mechad. EMF is not shields. Cards that affect shields do not affect EMF unless 
  they state they affect EMF. 
  <p>In addition to not being able to generate more EMF than twice the strength 
  of the unit, EMF is not allowed to be generated in excess of the sum of the 
  strength of the unit and the strength of the EMF immediately prior to the 
  Allocation Phase. As an example, an S8 Mechad Battleship is played with an EMF 
  strength of eight. If it sustains five points of damage, its EMF strength 
  becomes three. During the next Allocation Phase, it may not be raised above 
  either limit (sixteen and eleven). If it is brought to eleven, and remains at 
  eleven until the next Allocation Phase, the new limits will be sixteen and 
  nineteen. Since both limits apply, the lower limit may not be exceeded. 
  </p><p>EMF absorbs damage in a similar manner to shields. It will not absorb 
  damage stated as structural. Damage which bypasses shields must also state 
  EMF, or the EMF will still protect the unit. The P.O.T.'s shield penetration 
  device states in the rules that it also bypasses EMF. 
  </p><p>The strength of a unit's EMF is indicated by one or more dice. When damage 
  is applied to the EMF, the strength of the EMF is reduced (adjust the dice). 
  EMF never uses dice to indicate damage as the absorbed damage results in a 
  decrease in strength (this is an exception to how damage is scored). During 
  the Allocation Phase, EMF on units in the fleet is not repaired, it is 
  generated anew. 
  </p><p>EMF is generated through the use of nodes. Only a card with nodes may 
  generate EMF. Cards with nodes may not have shield refits applied to them. 
  </p><p>If a card with nodes is not engaged during the Allocation Phase, it has an 
  EMF strength equal to the strength of the unit. EMF may not be increased to a 
  disengaged unit. If an engaged unit with nodes is disengaged outside of the 
  Allocation Phase (by a breakdown, for example), its EMF is not affected. If a 
  node refit is destroyed, the current strength of the EMF of the unit will not 
  be affected. 
  </p><p>When a unit with nodes is played, it has an EMF strength equal to the 
  unit's strength. 
  </p><p>EMF is not considered engagement energy and is not considered for the 
  purposes of escaping a gravity pocket. The production of EMF is not affected 
  by the Corporate E6 Warp Field Destabilization Gun. </p>
  </dd><dt><b>Engagement Phase:</b> 
  </dt><dd>See "Allocation Phase" in this section. 
  </dd><dt><b>Exceptions:</b> 
  </dt><dd>The deck stocking rules allow three exceptions to the support rules. You 
  are allowed up to three cards in your deck which are not supported by at least 
  one card of each lesser strength in the same category. Having ships of 
  strength one through seven, two S9s and one S10 would be three exceptions. The 
  two S9s and one S10 are the exceptions. The absence of an S8 is not the 
  exception. 
  </dd><dt><b>Exclusive Empire Crew:</b> 
  </dt><dd>These crew may only be played in a deck representing that empire. 
  </dd><dt><b>Filarian Infesters:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Filarian Infester ability cards may only be used in a Filarian deck. 
  Infesters may only control ship stacks (not dragons or any other card type). A 
  free command slot (or half a slot where appropriate) is required to take 
  control of any card which consumes a command slot (this applies to any form of 
  control, not just Filarian). They gain control of the ship and all cards on 
  the ship stack in the same fleet as the ship (cards played to the ship, not 
  cards played against it). The infested ship stack is moved to the infester's 
  fleet (an exception to the rule that a player's cards are always considered in 
  his fleet, even when against an opponent's fleet). Neither player may 
  voluntarily discard such cards. The Filarian player may not play cards to any 
  cards controlled in this manner (including the ship itself). 
  </dd><dt><b>Free Flying Shuttles:</b> 
  </dt><dd>A free flying shuttle is any shuttle (fighters are shuttles) which is not 
  on another card. Certain crew allow a shuttle to be played independently (i.e. 
  free flying). Also any shuttle moving from one location to another is 
  considered to be a free-flying shuttle while in transition to its new 
  location. It is not a normal function of a shuttle to remain independent. 
  Another card in play must state that they may be in play in this manner. 
  Fighter pilots only affect shuttles at their location and must therefore 
  accompany a shuttle for it to be a free flying shuttle. A free flying shuttle 
  may be the target of weapons fire as is stated in the rules under "Weapon 
  Rules: Standard Targets". 
  </dd><dt><b>Friendly Fire:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Cards are not restricted from firing at their own fleet. The only such 
  restriction is that no card may fire at itself. 
  </dd><dt><b>Fully Engaged:</b> 
  </dt><dd>A fully engaged card is both engaged and armed. All weapons and ship 
  systems are armed. A card with nodes, which is fully engaged by another card, 
  may be given EMF equal to twice its strength. However, EMF is not required for 
  such a card to be considered fully engaged. 
  </dd><dt><b>Generic Ships:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Ships with the generic ship background (horizontal blue lines on a blue 
  background) are generic ships. Generic ships are not empire-specific. Having 
  no empire, they may not be used as a main empire. They do not have to be 
  supported by 4 non-minor empire ships and may not be used as a non-minor 
  empire ship supporting a minor empire ship. 
  </dd><dt><b>Heavy Weapons:</b> 
  </dt><dd>A heavy weapon requires an ammunition point to be fired. Once loaded, it 
  remains loaded for a complete turn (until it sees another Allocation Phase) or 
  until fired (whichever happens first). If you gain control of an engaged ship, 
  you would only be able to fire heavy weapons on the turn that control is 
  established if its previous controller armed the heavy weapons and did not 
  fire them (some cards which control other cards exempt themselves from this 
  point requirement). 
  </dd><dt><b>Independent Shuttle:</b> 
  </dt><dd>See "Free Flying Shuttles" in this section. 
  </dd><dt><b>Indirigan:</b> 
  </dt><dd>The Indirigans are divided into tribes. Each tribe is a separate empire, 
  but they are all affected by cards which affect Indirigans. 
  </dd><dt><b>Mine Deployment System (MDS):</b> 
  </dt><dd>A loaded (1 supply required) MDS is activated as a card action with a mine 
  played to the ship to use the mine without discarding the mine. Each MDS may 
  only be used once per turn. Two loaded MDSs may not activate the same card 
  because each requires its own mine. Also, a single mine may only be used once 
  per turn. The MDS may be loaded during the Allocation Phase regardless of the 
  existance of a mine. A mine may be played to a ship after the MDS is loaded. 
  An MDS is not required to activate the same mine it activated on a previous 
  turn. 
  </dd><dt><b>Modifiers:</b> 
  </dt><dd>The following list covers various types of modifications. 
  <p>
  </p><dl>
    <dt>Terrain Output Modifiers: 
    </dt><dd>Terrain output modifiers are the only type that are limited. Only the 
    greatest additive modifier and the greatest beneficial multiplicative 
    (greater than x1) for each point type are applied to the terrain. Always 
    apply modifiers in the following order: Additive, beneficial multiplicative, 
    subtractive modifiers, and finally detrimental multiplicative (less than 
    x1). There is no limit on detrimental and subtractive modifiers. 
    </dd><dt>Weapon fire modification: 
    </dt><dd>There is no limit on the number of cards that may modify the damage 
    caused by weapons fire. For an exception, see "O9 Catastrophic Repetition" 
    under "Cards by Type and Strength". </dd></dl>
  </dd><dt><b>Non-Passive (NP):</b> 
  </dt><dd>All equipment is rated either P (for passive) or NP (for non-passive). 
  Non-passive equipment may not be engaged at a disengaged location. When played 
  to a disengaged location it is played disengaged regardless of its engagement 
  cost. See "Passive" in this section. 
  </dd><dt><b>Passive (P):</b> 
  </dt><dd>All equipment is rated either P (for passive) or NP (for non-passive). 
  Passive equipment may be engaged regardless of the engagement state of its 
  location. See "Non-Passive" in this section. 
  </dd><dt><b>Persona:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Personas are distinguished by the word persona above the card text. Cards 
  which state "only one such card may be in play" use the same rules as 
  personas. While a persona is in play, no player may play that same card. If a 
  persona is removed from play, the card is no longer restricted from being 
  played. If any effect causes a second copy of a persona to come into play, the 
  newly appearing persona would be discarded. 
  </dd><dt><b>Played against an opponent...:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Any card played against an opponent is considered in the fleet of the 
  person who played the card. It is considered against the opponent's fleet. The 
  person who played it may repair it, play other cards to it, etc. 
  <p>If you play a T6 Black Hole against an opponent, you could play a base on 
  it. You could not play a B5 Penal Colony on it because the penal colony is 
  played against opponent terrain. </p>
  </dd><dt><b>Player Turn:</b> 
  </dt><dd>A player turn is from the beginning of the current player's turn to the 
  beginning of the next player's turn. A turn and a complete turn are not a 
  player turn. 
  <p>Cards with a duration measured in player turns start their count on the 
  turn played, with the next player's Allocation Phase being one player turn. 
  </p>
  </dd><dt><b>Psy Being:</b> 
  </dt><dd>A psy being is any card which can use a psy function. 
  </dd><dt><b>Reaction Cards:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Reaction cards may be played on any player's turn in reaction to an 
  opponent doing one of the following: allocating points, playing a card, 
  performing a card action (including producing points or firing weapons), or 
  voluntarily discarding a card during the Discard Phase. However, to play a 
  reaction card on your turn requires an available card play. 
  </dd><dt><b>Removed from play:</b> 
  </dt><dd>When a card is removed from play (by such cards as an H1 Time Warp or R/O1 
  Time Skip), its location is not changed. The affected card's entire stack is 
  just treated as if it were not currently part of the game until the effect is 
  over. The only exception is the card removing the stack from play does not 
  remove itself from play. 
  <p>If a card returns to play and its location has been destroyed, it is 
  discarded if it cannot survive independently. 
  </p><p>As an example, if a base with a time warp played against it has its terrain 
  destroyed out from underneath it, the base is not immediately discarded 
  because it is not currently in play. When the duration expires on the time 
  warp, the base would be discarded because it may not be played independently. 
  </p><p>If a card is removed from play after performing an action but before the 
  effect is resolved, the effect is delayed until the card returns to play. If 
  the action is still possible, it is performed at this time (opponents may 
  react again). If the action is inappropriate at this time (such as a time 
  skipped unlucky targeting coming into play at the end of the turn or a time 
  skipped shuttle going to a ship that was already destroyed), it is voided. 
  When the action is voided, the card continues as if the action has happened 
  (the unlucky targeting is discarded after use, whereas the shuttle simply 
  returns). </p>
  </dd><dt><b>Requires a transporter, shuttle or fighter...:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Crew no longer require transportation to function. Such crew operate at 
  their location. They only need transportation to perform their function at a 
  different location. 
  </dd><dt><b>Shuttles:</b> 
  </dt><dd>First, fighters are a subset of shuttles (any reference to shuttles also 
  refers to fighters). Second, equipment may only be played to units (ships or 
  bases). Shuttles which change locations may move to terrain or installations. 
  A shuttle in play on terrain will still function and is not considered free 
  flying. 
  <p>The phrase "one shot only" after the phaser(s) of a shuttle indicates that 
  each phaser may only be shot once. Certain cards rearm the phasers. This 
  restores their one-shot capability. They may still not be fired more than once 
  per turn. Once fired, they must be rearmed again before they can fire. 
  </p><p>Also, any shuttle capable of transporting crew is also capable of moving 
  without crew. Most, but not all, state they may transport up to their 
  capacity. This includes transporting zero crew. 
  </p><p>Shuttles may transport disengaged crew, as transporting a crew is a 
  function of the shuttle, not the crew. The same applies to transporters. </p>
  </dd><dt><b>Splash Damage:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Whenever a card is played in reaction mode to prevent damage from being 
  applied to a target, the damage being applied to the protected card is 
  diverted to the protecting card. If the damage is sufficient to destroy the 
  protecting card, any damage not needed to destroy the protecting card will 
  splash through to the protected target. If the protected target requires a 
  certain type of damage to be affected, but the protecting card can be 
  destroyed by other types of damage included in a volley, the other type of 
  damage will be used to destroy the protector. This allows the appropriate type 
  of damage to splash through. 
  <p>Damage only splashes through cards just played in reaction mode. If a card 
  was already in play, the splash damage rules do not apply. </p>
  </dd><dt><b>Stack:</b> 
  </dt><dd>A stack is any card and cards played to or against the card, and any card 
  played to or against those cards, etc. A single card is a stack, however it is 
  not a stack of cards (cards being plural). 
  </dd><dt><b>Structural Damage:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Structural damage is damage which is applied directly to the structure, 
  ignoring shields, EMF, and armor systems. Only cards which state they cause 
  structural damage cause direct structural damage. As of the Universe Edition 
  printing, boarding parties, the C5 Suicide Squad and the C9 Marauder cause 
  structural damage. 
  </dd><dt><b>Suark Breed:</b> 
  </dt><dd>The controller of the highest strength suark may play one card during each 
  opponent's Play Cards Phase A. Once a person plays a card during Play Cards 
  Phase A, you may play your card after the effects of the opponent's card have 
  been resolved. It is not done in reaction mode. Once you play your card, and 
  any reactions to the played cards are resolved, the current player may 
  continue with his turn. If a player announced that he is ready to end his Play 
  Cards Phase A, and a player plays a card using a suark breed, the current 
  player would still be eligable to play cards during the phase. 
  <p>When any crew in any fleet (not from the hand or the time origin) is going 
  to be discarded (even during the discard phase), the lowest strength suark 
  breed in play is discarded instead. If, for any reason, the crew must still be 
  discarded (his location is gone or his current strength is equal or less than 
  zero), the crew is then discarded. In any such case, only one suark would be 
  discarded for a single crew being discarded. </p>
  </dd><dt><b>Terrain:</b> 
  </dt><dd>The only things that may damage terrain are cards which state they can 
  damage terrain and heavy weapons fire. Cards like the C9 Marauder (which may 
  be transported to an opponent location) cannot cause its damage to a terrain 
  because it does not state that it may. 
  </dd><dt><b>Turn:</b> 
  </dt><dd>See "Complete Turn" in this section. 
  </dd><dt><b>Unexposed:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Unexposed cards are positioned face down. Cards on a time capsule are 
  moved to the time capsule unexposed. They are considered out of play until the 
  time capsule is resolved. A time shield, however, is played to the ship stack 
  with which it is played. The unexposed cards, in this case, are treated 
  exactly as if they were exposed (except opponents may not see the front of the 
  exposed cards). A card under a time shield performing an action must be 
  exposed when the action is declared. If an unexposed card is moved away from a 
  time shield, it must be exposed. 
  </dd><dt><b>Voided:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Any time a card play or action is no longer legal, it is voided. Any time 
  an action is voided, the card action is still considered used for that turn. 
  <p>When an action is voided, the card is discarded if normally discarded after 
  use. Cards not normally discarded remain in play. 
  </p><p>If it is the card play (not the card's action) being voided, the card is 
  returned to the hand. Card plays are voided by such cards as the R/O1 Past 
  Transmission and R/O1 Time Compression. These cards affect a player's ability 
  to play cards. A card that finds itself played to an illegal location when its 
  effect resolves is a voided action not a voided play. </p>
  </dd><dt><b>Weapons Fire:</b> 
  </dt><dd>Cards played in reaction mode may only fire weapons if played during a 
  Weapons Fire Phase. Due to the rule that states you may only react to an 
  opponent's action, if an opponent does not fire weapons, you may not play a 
  reactionary card to fire its weapons. 
  </dd><dt><b>"X" Cards:</b> 
  </dt><dd>"X" cards refers to such phrases as time cards, cyber cards, etc. An "X" 
  card is any card with "X" in the name, either as a whole word or conjoined 
  with one or more words. L9 Accelerated Timeline is considered a time card 
  because the word timeline is a conjunction of time and line. Do not confuse an 
  "X" card with such things as a category card. A luck card is any L card, not a 
  card with luck in its title. Category always takes precedence in this case.

Answers</a></font></b></p>
<font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>A5 Temporal Comprehension</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>A5 Temporal Comprehension says that it "may perform its card actions twice 
  each turn, once during each Card Play phase." If this card is layed to a 
  Dragon, can the Dragon fire it's weapons twice, since a weapon's fire is 
  considered an action, isn't it? Or can it only perform actions twice which 
  normally take place on a card play phase as opposed to the weapons fire phase? 

  </li><li>Actually, Weapons fire is not really considered a Card Action for this 
  purpose, because it occurs in its own phase, so the answer is functions that 
  are done in a card play phase can be done in each card play phase.</li></font></ul>
<font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>A6 Gaia Separation</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>My Opponent has a T5 Moon with a A6 Gaia Separation on it. Can I lay a O4 
  Flood to it? 
  </li><li>Good question. TENTATIVE answer is no.</li></font></ul>
<font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>A6 Hostile Terrain</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>A T7 Sensor Planet has an O4 Flood played against it. Can the owner of the 
  T7 Sensor Planet lay a A6 Hostile Terrain against it thereby negating the O4 
  Flood or does he still have to apply the necessary points to the O4 Flood in 
  order to negate it? 
  </li><li>Still must pay off the flood, as it was modified before the Hostile 
  Terrain was played.</li></font></ul>
<font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>Base</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>Can more than 1 base be played to a Terrain\Terrain stack? 
  </li><li>Yes. Each one can create its own stack, or can be part of the same stack. 
  So, you could have a T9 Gas Giant with a R/B8 Citadel, and a few crew cards as 
  one stack, a B7 Academy as a seperate stack on the T9, and a B9 Starbase with 
  a B3 Heavy Planetary Shield, and some more crew as a third stack on the T9. 
  Remember though, this kind of terrain stacking becomes a major target.</li></font></ul>
<font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>B1 Military Outpost</p>
</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it have to be engaged in order to use the extra economy and supply 
  that it produces (since these symbols are under the graphic, and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not in the 
  top right hand corner of the card. <br>
&nbsp; <b>&nbsp; A. </b>&nbsp; It must be engaged to use those points. This is true of anything of a 
  similar nature, R/S2 Fleet Tug, etc.</p>
</font><font face="Arial">
<b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the B1 Military Outpost have to be engaged to produce the extra 
  Economy and Supply? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, but it can engage itself. (If it is going to be engaged, it produces 
  the points.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a B1 Military Outpost on a T6 Moon. My opponent lays a O4 Flood 
  against it. Since the B1 Military Outpost adds an Economy <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and a Supply, do I 
  need to apply these also to negate the O4 Flood? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Only if the Outpost is engaged the turn that the flood will be payed 
  off.</p>
</font><font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>B5 Penal Colony</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>Can the 3 economy points that the oponent allocates to the Penal Colony be 
  used by the owner of the card? If the person does not have 3 economy, does it 
  just allocate as much as it has? ie, if the person only has 2 economy? 
  </li><li>No one can use the economy. Yes, you only allocate as many as there are 
  available up to three.</li></font></ul>
<font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>R/B8 Citadel</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>If opponent fires on one of my Terrain, can I lay a R/B8 Citadel in 
  reaction even if I have no available command slots open? 
  </li><li>No. There must be a command slot open in the fleet that the Card that 
  takes the command slot is going to be played to.</li></font></ul>
<font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>Dragon Empire</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>I am playing the POT empire and my wife plays the Dragon empire. I have 
  many cards (i.e. Hazards) that say that it does damage to ships. Can I lay 
  these against her Dragons? 
  </li><li>Yes. Dragons are ships except for two instances. They cannot be effected 
  by O cards, and you cannot play crew to them, unless you have a card that 
  allows that.</li></font></ul>
<font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>D4 Rogue Dragoness</p>
</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Opponent plays a D4 Rogue Dragoness one of my Terrains. Does the D4 Rogue 
  Dragoness still protect the opponent's sector HQ is this case? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; No it doesn't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I need a base or ship at the location (my Terrain) to kill the D4 Rogue 
  Dragoness? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Not unless the Rogue Dragoness says it can only be damaged by cards at its 
  location.</p>
</font><font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>D4 Rogue Dragoness</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>Can I kill it the D4 Rogue Dragoness in any other way, such as with Hazard 
  cards? 
  </li><li>Yes, as long as it doesn't say it can't take damage from hazards. Dragons 
  can be effected by hazards just like ships. Occurences cannot effect 
  Dragons.</li></font></ul>
<font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>D7 Neutron Dragoness</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>If I have a D7 Neutron Dragoness, can I play a R/O4 Repair Delivery to 
  repair it? Since I believe that the rule book says that Occurrence, Crew and 
  Equipment can't be played to a Dragon. 
  </li><li>No you can't, just because of the rule you stated.</li></font></ul>
<font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>E2 Nuclear Mine</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>Do I lay this card to my ship and hence it does 2 damage to my oponent's 
  ship(or dragon), or do I lay this card onto my oponent's ship and it does to 
  damage to my oponent's ship? 
  </li><li>You play it to one of your ships to do damage to another ship. The Tufor's 
  can reuse the mines on their ships, otherwise after they are played they are 
  discarded. You must have a ship in play(any kind) to use a mine.</li></font></ul>
<font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>G4 Gas Solitude</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>During what phase do I pick up the 4 cards if I meet the criteria. Also if 
  I lay this card (expose it), does the criteria have to be met on the current 
  turn or can it be met on any future turn? 
  </li><li>When the criteria is met. If it is exposed, it cannot be fullfilled until 
  "one complete turn after the agenda has been played".</li></font></ul>
<font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>H6 Defensive Mine Field</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>This card says it's played to ships in play against the fleet? What 
  exactly does this mean? Can I lay this card to all the ships in one of my 
  opponent's fleet? 
  </li><li>In Piracy one of the major themes is "playing a ship against someones 
  fleet", this is usually done to steal the allocation costs from a planet to 
  power your ship, and make your opponent lose those points from their 
  allocation phase. This Mine Field is played to a ship played against your 
  terrain.</li></font></ul>
<font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>H8 Quark</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>Do I lay this card to one of my Terrain's or to my opponent's Terrain? So 
  if I can play it to my Terrain, suppose a T7 Sensor Planet, I can then go 
  ahead and discard my own planet and draw 7 cards? 
  </li><li>One of your own, and yes you draw the cards.</li></font></ul>
<font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>H9 Dimensional Portal</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>This card states, "Portal is discarded by research points equal to twice 
  the strength of the ship. All research must be applied by the affected ship 
  stack." Is there a way of applying the research points? Can you give an 
  example? 
  </li><li>This is like a permanent Time Warp unless you use this card on a 
  Scintillating Dragoness, or a ship that produces Research.</li></font></ul>
<font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>L6 Artifact - Scepter of Time</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>This card states, "Two extra card draws". When do these 2 extra card draws 
  take place? Immediately or during the card draw phase? 
  </li><li>Card draw phase, as it does not say two immediate cards.</li></font></ul>
<font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>R/L7 Temporal Correction</p>
</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; If an O4 Flood is on one of my Terrain stacks and as a reaction I lay a 
  R/L7 Temporal Correction to it, the O4 Flood is discarded. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I still need to 
  apply equal to that of my Terrain for that turn? How about consecutive turns?
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A. </b>&nbsp; The O4 Flood is gone. The terrain will not be available for use until next 
  turn unless you managed to play the R/L7 on your allocation phase. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, 
  while the O4 Flood is there even if you apply the proper points to the terrain 
  during your allocation phase the terrain would not <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be available until the next 
  turn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q.</b>&nbsp; Can I use this card to discard a ship or base that an opponent plays, or 
  does the opponent's card have to be played to my fleet? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be played to your fleet.</p>

<b>
<p>R/M1 Sextaraan Web Crawlers</p>
</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Opponent has a D4 Magus Dragoness which states "Damage only by research 
  points". Can I lay a R/M1 Sextaraan Web Crawlers <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; against it, which says that 
  it causes 2 damage per turn to ship or monster, so can this do damage to the 
  D4 Magus Dragoness <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even though the D4 Magus Dragoness says it can only be 
  damaged by Research Points <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A.</b>&nbsp; No. Magus Dragoness has special damage characteristics, that must be met 
  by anything to do damage to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; On whose turn does the R/M1 Sextaraan Web Crawlers do the damage. I assume 
  that when I lay it in reaction, it does the damage <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on my opponent's turn (as 
  soon as I lay it) and then again on my turn and then on my following turn, 
  etc. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I lay a R/M1 Sextaraan Web Crawlers to an M9 Kraken or a M5 
  Astromorph? Does the R/M1 Sextaraan Web Crawlers do damage <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to these, since the 
  M9 Kraken says that it can only be negated by 9 research points and the M5 Astromorph says that it can only 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be destroyed by Heavy Weapons.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; You cannot play a Monster to a Monster, unless the text of the card 
  specifically states that you can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q. </b>&nbsp; Opponent has a M7 Space Illness, which states "Discarded when the unit is 
  destroyed", in play against my ship. Can I lay a <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R/M1 Sextaraan Web Crawlers 
  to the M7 Space Illness. Since it says that it can be played against monsters.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; No. The sextaraan web crawler is a monster. Monsters have rules on them 
  for how it is negated or destroyed.</p>
</font><font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>M3 Alien Parasites</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>This card states, "Discarded after research points equal to its strength 
  have been applied". Does this mean the strength of the M3 Alien Parasites or 
  the strength of the ship that it is played against? 
  </li><li>Its strength is always the monsters strength unless the card states 
  specifically the target of the monster. So in your case three research 
  points.</li></font></ul>
<font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>M4 Vymezies Matter</p>
</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I lay an M4 Vymezies Matter on an opponent's Terrain. As a reaction, my 
  opponent lays an R/L7 Anomaly Portal. As a result of this, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the M4 Vymezies 
  Matter goes to me (as I am the only player left). If I have no Terrain of 
  strength 4 or less (i.e., I only have a T5), is <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the M4 Vymezies Matter simply 
  discarded and hence does no damage to me? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is discarded, because it must be played to a terrain of equal or lesser 
  strength.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; If a Base or R/D6 Solar Dragoness is on a T4 Planet, can I still play a M4 
  Vymezies Matter to it? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes. It is played to the terrain.</p>
</font><font face="Arial">
<b>
<p>M5 Astromorph</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>I play this card against an opponent's fleet. When the ship it is 
  attacking is destroyed, is the Astromorph discarded or can it attack another 
  ship in the fleet on the next turn? 
  </li><li>The Astromorph says it can only be damaged by heavy weapons. On the next 
  turn after it destroys its initial target, the player who played the M5

<p>Terrain</p>
</b></font><ul><font face="Arial"><b></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
  <li>If a card says that it is "Played to a Terrain", is this played to an 
  entire stack of Terrains or can it be played to an individual Terrain in the 
  stack? 
  </li><li>This is more complicated than the way you asked it. A terrain card is 
  generally the basis of a stack. Most terrain that is played to another terrain 
  is incorporated into that terrain. For example: You have a T5 Star, and you 
  play a T5 planet to it. It is now a T10. You cannot damage them, or treat them 
  as individuals. So when you say is it "played to an individual terrain in the 
  stack", it is played to the only terrain in the stack whether a combined 
  terrain, or an individual. </li></font></ul>

  8? or 2 energy + 2 + 2 = 6? 
  </li><li>You would have a T13 terrain that produces 4 economy, 4 supply, and 20 
  energy. The original 1 economy, 1 supply, and 2 energy. The multiplication of 
  the first T4 plus its energy, and then the multiplication of the T9 you played 
  the next T4 to plus its four energy. By the way, you would also have one hell

  the fire onto Multiple targets. I.e., can I fire 3 phasers against one unit 
  and 2 phasers and 3 heavy weapons against another? Also, if I have 2 ships 
  that I want to fire against a unit, do they fire at the same time, or can 1 
  ship fire it's weapons first, then fire some of its weapons against another 
  unit and then have the 2nd ship fire its weapons against the first unit that 
  the 1st ship fired on. 
  </li><li>Yes you could fire at eight different targets if you wanted too. When you 
  fire at a target the total fire at that target is a volley. This is true 
  whether it comes from one ship, two ships, a ship, and a base, or whatever. 
  This is an important concept in the game. The reason it is important is this. 
  As a defending player I know you can fire one volley at each target in my 
  fleet each turn. This allows me to have a defensive stratedgy. For example: I 
  have a S2 Vektrean Frigate, and a S4 Vektrean Light Cruiser. In my hand I have 
  a R/L2 Phaser Malfunction Card. You first fire four phasers at my Frigate 
  destroying it. I allow this to happen. You then fire 2 heavy weapons, and five 
  phasers from two different locations. Let's say that three phasers came from 
  one location. I play the R/L2 Phaser Malfunction to that unit. My Light 
  Cruiser sustains four hits, two heavy, and two phasers. You cannot fire at the 
  Light Cruiser again. I have nothing left you can fire at because you cannot 
  fire at my Sector HQ even if you have twenty points of damage you can do. It

  reaction card? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A. </b>&nbsp; Well, for instance R/L4 Repair Malfunction is played in reaction to

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be played in 
  reaction to anything, pretty much anytime, unless the card says it must be 
  played at a specific time. How many <br>

  hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I lay a reaction card (on 
someone else's turn) even if it not reacting to anything (i.e., opponent has 
done anything yet). Does <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the reaction 
card that I lay in reaction to an opponent's action, have to effect the action 
of the opponent, or can the reaction card <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; affect 
something else? I.e., if my opponent lays a Hazard against one of my bases, can 
I play a reaction card to heal a ship? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A reaction card can be played in reaction to any action. Allocating, 
  repairing, firing, playing cards, etc. It does not have to be played <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; against a 
  specific thing unless the card states it does. So for example, someones Sector 
  HQ is open to attack, you could play a <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R/S1 Ship form the Future as a reaction 
  to another players card play, and fire the four phasers at the Sector 
HQ.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="errata">Cards Errata by Type and Strength</a></h2>
<p><b>Leopan Sector HQ:</b> The text about not allying with other empires is 
flavor text, not a rule. 
</p><p><b>A1 Millenia Molting (PE/UE):</b> All Molting cards should have the 
following errata applied: 
</p><p>The second rules line should read 'More than one molting card may be played 
on a D dragon'. Non-space dragon dragons (i.e. Orgons) may use molting cards. 
</p><p><b>A3 Star Walker:</b> This card allows a psy to perform a there-and-back 
mission to a location. The clauses "without transportation" and "ignoring 
shields" are merely clarifications. The phrase "without transportation" simply 
clarifies that this card grants the ability of transportation (no transporter or 
shuttle needed). The clause "ignoring shields" states that you can transport 
through shields. As a card action, the there-and-back mission must be performed 
during a card play phase (preferably Play Cards Phase A). 
</p><p>On the turn when this is done, psy damage caused by the psy to that location 
is doubled. It does not cause direct structural damage. Only cards that state 
their damage is structural cause structural damage. 
</p><p><b>A3 Tri-Millenia Molting:</b> See "A1 Millenia Molting" in this section for 
clarification on the rules for dragon moltings. 
</p><p><b>A5 Ancient Molting:</b> See "A1 Millenia Molting" in this section for 
clarification on the rules for dragon moltings. 
</p><p><b>A5 Blood Clydon:</b> This card does not have to be played to an 
attack-capable crew. It grants the crew the ability to make up to 4 attacks to 
destroy crew or equipment of equal or lesser strength than the crew. 
</p><p><b>A6 Filarian Infester (PoM/nc):</b> Multiple infesters may combine their 
strength against a single crew. May only be used in a Filarian deck. 
</p><p><b>R/A7 Cyborg Death (NE/nc):</b> The card is discarded after use. 
</p><p><b>A7 Eon Molting:</b> See "A1 Millenia Molting" in this section for 
clarification on the rules for dragon moltings. 
</p><p><b>C1 Sysop:</b> The sysop only allows equipment to function as if it was 
also in play on a second location. It does not create a copy of the equipment. A 
mine functioning as if it was elsewhere would still be discarded after use. If 
it was activated by a mine deployment system, it would still not be able to be 
used at the other location, because any function of a card may only be used once 
per turn. The sysop's practical use is with equipment that does not perform a 
card action. An example would be an E6 Deflection/Transfer Device. The device is 
not limited to once a turn because of the fact that it is not a card action of 
the device but a rule on the card being employed. 
</p><p><b>C3 Cryogenic Convict:</b> The convict is played against a location in an 
opponent fleet without a penal colony. The fleet (not the location) it is played 
against must not have a penal colony. Only a penal colony in play in the 
opponent's fleet (a penal colony they played) can prevent the convict from being 
played. A penal colony played against their fleet is not in their fleet (only 
against their fleet). 
</p><p>It is the controller of the location of the cryogenic convict that must pay 
to fund capture efforts. If you move the convict to a location in your fleet, 
you will have to pay until you move him against an opponent location. 
</p><p><b>C4 Corrupt Politician (UE):</b> Played against an opponent location. 
</p><p><b>C5/5 Time Knight:</b> Cards which are moved must be legally placed. For 
example, you couldn't remove a B6 Battlestation and place it on a crew. 
</p><p><b>C5 Weapons Officer (UE):</b> Multiplies the damage caused by the weapons 
at his location by 1.5. 
</p><p><b>R/C6 Damage Control Team (PE/UE):</b> When played in reaction, must be 
played to the ship or base it is saving from being destroyed. 
</p><p><b>C6 Rogue Couple:</b> The term "weakest ship" refers to the ship with the 
lowest strength. If played against the weakest ship in all opponent fleets, the 
controller of the rogue couple controls the ship. If it is moved off of the 
ship, control reverts to the original controller. It may then control the lowest 
strength ship in all opponent fleets by moving to that location. If a weaker 
ship is played, the rogue couple can continue controlling the ship against which 
it is played. However, if they leave their ship, they would have to take the 
lowest strength ship. See "Control" under "Various Subjects". 
</p><p><b>C7 Saboteur:</b> The clause about when research can be applied only refers 
to how he may normally be destroyed. If a Filarian Infester is played to him, 
research may be applied to him for purposes of getting rid of the infested crew. 
Any research applied for one purpose may not be used for the other. 
</p><p><b>C8 Freelance Purist:</b> The purist may negate one point of Sector HQ 
damage each complete turn. Damage negation only applies to currently occurring 
damage, not previously applied damage. He does not repair the Sector HQ. 
</p><p><b>C9 Marauder:</b> The marauder states that he may do two of his functions 
each turn. These must be two different functions. 
</p><p><b>R/C9 Temporal Engineer:</b> The temporal engineer states "Immediately draw 
2 cards when this is played". Immediately means during the current phase (rather 
than during the Draw Cards Phase). When played means this function may only be 
used when the card was just played. 
</p><p>There seems to be some problem with an L9 Accellerated Timeline and two 
temporal engineers fetching each other from the bottom of the deck to get an 
infinite number of 2 card draws. The accellerated timeline does not allow this. 
See "L9 Accellerated Timeline" in this section. 
</p><p><b>C9/1 Time Knight:</b> This time knight may negate a reaction card just 
played. The term reaction card, as it is used here, refers to any card played in 
reaction mode. He cannot stop a card with an "R/" unless that card is being 
played in reaction mode. 
</p><p><b>D3 Plasma Dragoness:</b> The dragon's controller can decide which weapon 
(from which source) in a multi-source volley scores the final point of damage. 
</p><p><b>D10 Draxos III - Dragon Queen:</b> The dragon queen doubles the breath 
weapons, not the damage caused by the breath weapons. A dragon with four breath 
weapons now has 8 breath weapons. Each of the 8 breath weapons now requires an 
ammunition point. 
</p><p><b>R/E2 Tractor Beam:</b> The tractor beam states that the affected unit may 
only target the tractor beam's location. If a ship is given the same restriction 
at another location then there is no legal target for the ship's weapons fire. 
</p><p><b>R/E2 Transporter - Nuclear Mine (PE/nc) &lt;misprint&gt;:</b> This card 
says 'R/E2 Transporter' along the top and 'Nuclear Mine' above the card text. It 
is considered an exactly identical card to the E2 Nuclear Mine and is not 
reactionary. 
</p><p><b>E4 Command and Control Center:</b> This equipment may be played to a unit 
or terrain. One card which generates command points (plural) at location may 
perform its functions twice per turn. Its location may not benefit by this 
equipment. Specifically, if played to a ship or base that generates command 
points, that unit would not be affected. Only cards generating command points at 
that location can be affected. Also note that weapons fire is not a function. 
</p><p><b>R/E4 Monster Defense System (AT):</b> In Advanced Technologies, the 
Monster Defense System received a major overhaul. It is now reactionary, 
passive, and no longer has an engagement cost. 
</p><p><b>R/E4 Transporter Mine (UE/NE):</b> The transporter mine requires a 
transporter to be activated against a ship, causing 2 points of damage (not 1 as 
stated in the text of the Universe Edition printing of the card). As the mine is 
not being transported to the new ship, only activated against it, it can affect 
dragons. The ship's shields need not be lowered for the transporter to function. 
The shields of the ship protect against this damage because it does not state 
that it causes structural damage. <br><i>Editor's Note: This error was made in 
Universe Edition and corrected in New Empires. We currently blame all such 
temporal anomalies on the Time Gates expansion.</i> 
</p><p><b>E5 Antimatter Mine:</b> This card is activated against a ship. It destroys 
all the ship's shields and causes two points of structural damage. It does not 
affect EMF, but the two points of structural damage are still caused to the 
structure of a unit with EMF. It can not damage the shields of a ship with an 
R/T2 Asteroid Shield, but the asteroid shield does not block the structural 
damage. An E6 Deflection/Transfer Device will transfer half of the shield damage 
plus one point of structural damage. The deflected damage would be received as 
standard damage with one point of direct structural damage. 
</p><p><b>E6 Deflection/Transfer Device:</b> The deflection/transfer device (DTD) 
only deflects damage that the ship is actually taking. Damage reduction or 
prevention is applied before the DTD may be used. A second DTD on the same unit 
will deflect half of the damage remaining from the first DTD. Deflected damage 
retains all of its original properties (including <b>direct</b> structural 
damage). If weapons fire damage is deflected to a unit immune to weapons fire, 
the unit will not be harmed. 
</p><p><b>E7 Argonian Strobe:</b> The strobe may not be activated against a fleet if 
it was activated against the same fleet on the previous turn. If a fleet is 
affected by a second strobe, the same units may be selected. 
</p><p><b>E8 Mechad Network Interface:</b> When played to a Mechad ship, it creates 
a clone of the ship stack. The clone also has an interface, but it is busy 
interfacing with the real ship. You cannot create a copy of the copy with the 
copy of the interface. Both ships require poihnts and must be engaged and armed 
separately. They are not required to have the same EMF strength or the same 
number of armed heavy weapons. 
</p><p>If the real ship becomes disengaged, the real equipment will also disengage 
(it is non-passive). This would cause the copy to disappear (it only exists due 
to the rule on the equipment). The loss of the copy in this manner does not 
count as the copy being destroyed and will not discard the interface. 
</p><p>When the card is first played, the copy of the ship is created. It is treated 
as if the copy of the ship was just played. The copy ship would be disengaged 
(unless the interface was on a ship with no engagement cost). 
</p><p><b>F4 Terrain Field (PoM/nc) &lt;clarification&gt;:</b> The level 10 function 
destroys any terrain of equal or lesser strength than the function (i.e., 
strength 10 or less). It does not apply card damage. It either destroys the 
terrain or it does nothing. 
</p><p><b>H4 Gravity Pocket:</b> The ship requiring excess engagement energy to 
escape may have such energy applied regardless of whether the remainder of their 
engagement cost (economy, supply, etc.) is paid. The ship may be engaged at its 
normal cost, but the gravity pocket will remain. Even though a ship is trapped 
in a gravity pocket, it may still function as normal. 
</p><p><b>H8 Gravity Pocket:</b> See "H4 Gravity Pocket" in this section. 
</p><p><b>H9 Dimensional Portal (PE/UE):</b> The dimensional portal functions by the 
following rules. It is played against an engaged ship. The ship remains engaged 
while in the portal. The ship stack may not affect or be affected by any fleet. 
The ship stack may not protect a Sector HQ or Psy Network. The portal is 
discarded after research equal to twice the strength of the ship is applied by 
the ship stack to the portal. The ship does not require a command slot. 
</p><p>If a Clydon ship, patrol ship courier, etc. in a dimensional portal 
separates, the portal stays on the main ship. When a Krebiz ship separates, the 
Krebiz ship's controller decides on which ship such cards remain. 
</p><p><b>H10 Akru Supernova (PE):</b> This card is discarded after use. 
</p><p><b>R/L3 Unlucky Targeting (UE):</b> Played against an opponent volley. 
Weapons volley is divided by 2. Fractions are always rounded down. Round down 
the total damage. A volley of one phaser, one heavy weapon and one physical 
damage will cause one point (1+1+1=3; 3/2=1.5) of damage. Only determine how 
much damage each weapon type causes if a specific type of damage is either 
needed or cannot damage the target. 
</p><p><b>R/L4 Miscommunications:</b> This card allows you to dictate the unused 
weapons of an opponent unit. Weapons are considered unused if their weapons fire 
has not been resolved. Declared, but as of yet unresolved weapons fire is 
available to be affected by a miscommunication. You must state each volley you 
wish to fire and resolve each volley before continuing with the current player's 
turn. Opponents may then react to the playing of the card and each declared 
volley (as each is resolved separately). 
</p><p>Causing an opponent's weapons to be fired at a location does not prevent that 
opponent from targeting that location. Since you are choosing the target, it 
only prevents you from again targeting that location on the same player turn. 
</p><p>Cards which fire weapons in a volley do not protect their Sector HQ or Psy 
Network from that volley. In a two-player game, this would allow a player to 
miscommunicate an opponent ship and (if no other cards are protecting their 
Sector HQ) fire its weapons at that opponent's Sector HQ. 
</p><p><b>R/L7 Temporal Correction:</b> The phrase "does not block card actions" 
prevents this card from being used on a card moving against the fleet to perform 
a card action. It may affect cards being played against the fleet and cards that 
were previously played against the fleet. It will also affect cards which were 
previously moved against the fleet and remained against the fleet. 
</p><p><b>R/L8 Advanced Preparedness:</b> This allows a card to be played in 
reaction mode. However the card played in reaction mode must follow all the 
rules of reaction cards. It must perform a function of the card (or use a rule 
on the card) when played. Blocking damage is also considered a function of cards 
which block damage. A ship may be played to protect a Sector HQ about to take 
damage. A base may be played to protect a terrain from weapons fire. 
</p><p><b>R/L8 Targeting Error (PE/UE):</b> Targeting Error states that you can 
redirect an opponent volley to any target in that opponent's fleet except cards 
which fired in that volley. Cards which fire weapons in a volley do not protect 
their Sector HQ or Psy Network from that volley. If a target is chosen that all 
participants in the volley cannot target, then the weapons fire from those 
participants incapable of firing becomes voided. 
</p><p><b>R/L8 Twist of Fate (TG/UE):</b> May only be played against an opponent's 
card that is not the basis of a stack. 
</p><p><b>L9 Accelerated Timeline:</b> On the turn played, the owning player may 
play any or all of the cards in his hand, ignoring the three-card limit (but not 
other limits). This card would count as a card play. Any card action of a card 
in play which is done as a card play still counts as a card play, so using a 
temporal engineer to retrieve the bottom of the Discard Pile (which states "As a 
card play,") also consumes a card play. 
</p><p>Only the playing of cards from the hand are exempt from the card play limit, 
and only those played after the accelerated timeline has taken effect gain this 
benefit. If an opponent reacts to your accelerated timeline, any reaction cards 
you play will consume a card play (as the accelerated timeline has not taken 
effect yet). 
</p><p><b>L10 Galactic Armageddon:</b> If this card is played, but the effect is not 
resolved, it may still be played by another (or the same) player. 
</p><p><b>L10 Galactic Cataclysm (errata):</b> This card is removed from play after 
use. 
</p><p><b>M2 Skullets (NE, UE/nc) &lt;clarification&gt;:</b> Skullets damage units 
(ships or bases). They are either played against a unit or played to a skull 
reaper and activated against a unit. 
</p><p><b>M3 Scandig Blob (NE, UE/nc) &lt;clarification&gt;:</b> Any monster 
destroyed by hazard damage may be damaged by any hazard that causes damage. 
Damage causing hazards that are played to other locations may be played to a 
Scandig Blob (or other monster damaged by hazards) to cause damage. Hazards, 
such as an H6 Large Minefield, may have their damage applied to such monsters, 
even though they say that it is only applied to cards of another type. 
</p><p><b>M3 Shield Fiend (PE/UE):</b> The shield fiend may be played on any card 
except a ship with an invinco guardian or EMF. Therefore it may affect any base, 
installation, terrain or monster equipped with shields (such as an M8 Ship 
Collector). 
</p><p><b>R/M4 Minor Luck Demon:</b> The R/M4 Minor Luck Demon is self-explanatory 
except in how it interacts with the R/M9 Luck Demon. First, the minor luck is 
limited to performing its action once per turn (as are all card actions). Also, 
since it is a luck demon, any R/M9 Luck Demons in play before it is played will 
no longer be considered the most recently played luck demon (see the "R/M9 Luck 
Demon" in this section). However the minor luck demon may not be played in 
reaction to prevent the theft of a luck card by the R/M9 Luck Demon. This is due 
to the rule that states reaction cards may only be played in reaction mode if 
they perform an action (or use a rule). There is no card action or rule on the 
minor luck demon stating that he stops luck demons. 
</p><p><b>M5 Astromorph:</b> The astromorph is played against a fleet. It moves 
against a ship and damages that ship each turn until the ship is destroyed. It 
may then move against another ship. 
</p><p><b>M5 Ship Mimic:</b> The ship mimic will mimic the actions of a ship (of 
equal or lesser strength). Consider the mimic to be a copy of the ship that does 
exactly what the ship does. It only mimics the ship, not the ship stack. Cards 
which modify the ships actions, such as a weapons officer or catastrophic 
repetition, will not be mimiced. The cards played to the ship that the ship 
mimic could mimic would be refits (cards that modify the ship itself). A phaser 
refit is being fired by the ship (and therefore is mimicked). It would also 
mimic the actions of a ship even if the action is caused by a card playl If an 
R/O3 Fighter Defense System is played to a ship with a mimic, when the ship 
fires its phasers, the mimic will also fire its phasers (mimicking the ship). 
</p><p>If an S3 Scorpead Troop Ship transports a boarding party off of terrain, the 
ship mimic also attempts to transport the same boarding party to the ship mimic 
(which is illegal and therefore voided). If a lucky targeting was played to the 
Scorpead troop ship and it fired one phaser (let's assume the x2 phaser 
magnifier was loaded), the mimic would fire one phaser in the same volley. The 
ship's phaser would cause three points (modified by the lucky targeting), and 
the mimic's 'phaser' would cause only two. 
</p><p>If an escort (with mimic) intercepts two points of damage, the mimic will 
intercept the same two points of damage (not an additional two). Both cards 
would take four points of damage, damaging the ship and not the mimic (mimics 
are not affected by weapons fire). 
</p><p><b>M5 Tectonic Burrower (NE, UE/nc):</b> This card causes the damage to the 
terrain against which it is played. This was accidentally omitted from the card. 
Errata is necessary because only cards which state they can damage terrain may 
cause damage to terrain. 
</p><p><b>M6 Seductress:</b> If the seductress is played to a science officer, the 
effect of the seductress would be suspended by the science officer as long as 
the officer is functioning. If played against a prophet, the prophet would be 
able to divert the card play. 
</p><p><b>M7 Astromorph:</b> See "M5 Astromorph" in this section. 
</p><p><b>M7 Juggernaut:</b> The juggernaut is played against a base. After 
destroying a base, he moves to another base (in any fleet). If no base is 
available, move him to your fleet and wait. You can then, at any time there is a 
base in play, move him to a base and attack (as a card action during your turn). 

</p><p><b>M8 Fatal Horror:</b> This monster is played to a unit and only affects 
crew on that unit. If a crew evacuates the unit, it will not be affected by the 
fatal horror. This card would have no effect if played to a unit without crew 
and would be considered voided. If all the crew leave after the horror has taken 
effect, it would not be voided. Instead it would be discarded and the unit 
disengaged (as per the card). 
</p><p><b>M8 Ship Collector (PE/UE):</b> The Ship Collector is now a persona. The 
previous errata about needing seven opponent ships in play is no longer in 
effect. 
</p><p><b>R/M9 Luck Demon (UE):</b> Any luck card played by a player to his own 
fleet may instead be played by the player controlling the R/M9 Luck Demon if he 
controls the most recently played luck demon in play. Also, luck cards played 
against a fleet with an R/M9 Luck Demon in play are ignored (discarded), unless 
the Luck Demon's controller wants to allow the card to be played. This second 
function is regardless of whether or not the luck demon has "most recently 
played" status. 
</p><p>The luck demon grants this ability. It is not a reactionary action of the 
luck demon. It is instead treated as a rule while in play (and is not limited to 
once per turn). Use of the card rule is timed as any reaction is timed. This is 
the difference between a card action (once per turn) and a card rule (active 
continuously). 
</p><p>The term "played to their own fleet" includes cards played to cards in their 
fleet, but not cards played against their cards by opponents or played to 
non-fleet locations such as the Discard Pile. See "Where are cards played" under 
"Playing Cards" and "L7 Alien Artifact" in this section. 
</p><p>The order in which Luck Demons are played is important. Only the most 
recently played luck demon in play may steal opponent luck cards. When a "most 
recently played" luck demon is removed from play (by any means), the next most 
recently played becomes the "most recently played" luck demon in play. If the 
absent demon returns to play, it will regain its status. See "R/M4 Minor Luck 
Demon" in this section. 
</p><p><b>M10 Zaggoth Guardian:</b> The guardian protects all monsters in the fleet. 
Any time a monster you played (any card you play is in your fleet) would be 
damaged, the guardian prevents the damage and takes one point of damage. Any 
card that allows a monsterr to be damaged, regardless of how it is normally 
damaged (such as some spiritual leaders) can damage the guardian. However the 
guardian will protect itself and only take a single point. 
</p><p><b>R/O3 Defensive Override (PE/UE):</b> All electronic warfare may now be 
played to a ship or base. 
</p><p><b>O3 Forced Retreat (PE/nc):</b> Discarded after use. 
</p><p><b>R/O3 Instant Reaction (TG/UE/PE):</b> This card has been reprinted in 
Persona to further clarify what has become the most misunderstood card in 
Galactic Empires. Here is how it is now worded: "Played to a reaction card. May 
only be played once each phase. The reaction card may use its functions in 
reaction mode, moving to any location. Any reaction card may only be used in 
reaction once each complete turn. Return this card to the hand if the reaction 
card is of equal or lesser strength. Otherwise, discard this card after use." 
</p><p><b>R/O3 Offensive Electronic Warfare (PE/UE):</b> All electronic warfare may 
now be played to a ship or base. Offensive electronic warfare can increase the 
damage caused by a heavy weapons volley, increasing the damage taken by terrain. 
The electronic warfare cards do not state they can damage terrain because it is 
the weapons, not the electronic warfare causing the damage. 
</p><p><b>R/O3 Offensive/Defensive Electronic Warfare (PE/UE/nc):</b> All electronic 
warfare may now be played to a ship or base. This card shows a -X or +X where it 
should read -X and +X. 
</p><p><b>O4 Information Leak (PE/UE):</b> Discarded after use. 
</p><p><b>R/O4 Repair Delivery (PE/UE):</b> A repair delivery is played to a 
location in the fleet. The repair points may be applied to ships, bases, terrain 
or the Sector HQ. It can be used to repair previous or currently occurring 
damage (preventing the damage from being scored). It may <b>not</b> repair card 
damage. See next entry for UE errata. 
</p><p><b>R/O4 Repair Delivery (UE/PE):</b> Discarded after use. <br><i>Editor's 
Note: See the editor's note on the R/E4 Transporter Mine regarding pre-corrected 
cards.</i> 
</p><p><b>O5 Forced Retreat (PE/nc):</b> Discarded after use. 
</p><p><b>O5 Insanity (PE/UE):</b> Insanity allows the controller of the insanity to 
dictate the actions of the crew. It now states that the crew may perform 
normally or perform the opposite of the following functions: point generation, 
point modification, card plays or card draws (modifications to the amount). 
Point generation/modification can be resource points, damage points, command 
points, etc. 
</p><p><b>O5 Political Upheval:</b> The phrase "Prevents the use of the terrain" 
indicates that it produces no points, may not perform card actions, and any 
rules on the card that affect other cards will no longer be in effect. 
</p><p><b>O5 Wandering Desire (PE/nc):</b> Discarded after use. Negated by a crew 
card of a strength greater than the strength of the wandering desire (6, not 4). 

</p><p><b>O6 Political Clout:</b> "Played against an opponent ship and terrain" is 
short for "Played against an opponent ship and an opponent terrain in the same 
fleet." 
</p><p><b>O7 Poker Night:</b> This card is discarded after use. 
</p><p><b>O7 Surprise Attack:</b> The surprise attack now states that the ship is 
played engaged and fully armed. All weapons and ship systems (heavy weapons, 
mine deployment systems, etc.) are loaded. Once the ship is played, the surprise 
attack is used (there is nothing more for it to do) and it is discarded. This 
card does not arm cards played after the ship is played, such as refits. 
</p><p><b>R/O8 Reserve Callup (errata):</b> Ships brought into play when this card 
is played in reaction to weapons fire are considered reaction cards for purpose 
of the splash rule. 
</p><p><b>O9 Catastrophic Repetition:</b> This card states "no other modifications 
allowed." Modifications are any card affecting the ship which adjust the damage 
caused by the ship. A phaser magnifier may be applied because, as a ship system, 
it is not considered a modification. It does prevent the use of lucky targeting 
because it modifies the weapons damage. It will not prevent an unlucky targeting 
because that affects the volley, not the ship's weapons. A ship mimic will mimic 
the action of the ship but does not mimic cards played to the ship. So the 
weapons fire of the ship mimic will do standard damage. Also note, this card 
only affects damage, not other effects of weapons such as those found on game 
supply ships. 
</p><p><b>O9 Discovery of Discoveries:</b> This card is discarded after use. 
</p><p><b>R/O10 And Now For Something Completely Different:</b> This card is 
discarded after use. 
</p><p><b>O10 Planetary Destruction:</b> This card states that it destroys any ships 
or bases on the terrain. The E10 Subspace Stabilizer only prevents a base from 
being discarded due to the destruction of the terrain. It will not stop the 
occurrence from destroying the base. If the terrain is saved by an R/C5 
Exogeologist, the bases and ships are still destroyed. <br>Errata: This card 
should be discarded after use. 
</p><p><b>S9 P.O.T. Battleship:</b> This ship may be used in any P.O.T. deck. It is 
not restricted to the Tequan element (that is flavor text). 
</p><p><b>S10 Explosive Ore Carrier:</b> The ore carrier's controller can decide 
which weapons (from which source) in a multi-source volley scored each point of 
structural damage. Any points in excess of what is needed to destroy the ore 
carrier are not considered to cause structural damage. Incoming damage negated 
by a repair delivery is never applied and will not cause retaliation. 
</p><p><b>R/T2 Asteroid Shield (PoM/UE):</b> The asteroid shield now states that it 
may not be the basis of a stack. This means that cards may not be played to or 
against it. 
</p><p>The asteroid shield prevents the ship from receiving damage (except direct 
structural damage). See "Splash Damage" and "Terrain" under "Various Subject". 
</p><p>Once the asteroid shield is in play, it continues to prevent damage to the 
ship, but no longer intercepts the damage. That rule only applies to cards 
played in reaction mode. Once in play, the terrain must be the target of damage 
to be damaged, and any excess damage would not splash through. 
</p><p><b>T5 Nebula - Homecloud Nebula:</b> This affects all Argonian ships in all 
fleets. 
</p><p><b>T/B5 Vektrean Asteroid Outpost (PE/UE):</b> All of the Vektrean asteroid 
terrain use the following rules: 
</p><p>Vektrean asteroid terrain are played and damaged as terrain, but are 
considered bases for all other purposes. 
</p><p>They may be played during turn 1 or 2. If played during turn 2, it would not 
count as your 1 unit, installation or psy played during that turn. 
</p><p>The same applies to command limits. Once played, they consume a command slot, 
but do not require a slot to be played. Note that it is legal to exceed your 
command limit. It only prevents you from playing a card which consumes a slot 
(except Vektrean asteroid bases). 
</p><p>The Vektrean asteroid bases are damaged as terrain. The structure of the base 
may only be damaged by heavy weapons and cards that state they damage terrain. 
The structure will suffer the effects of card damage (see "Card Damage" under 
"Various Subjects"). Only the heavy weapons portion of a weapons volley can 
damage the structure. The shields protect against card damage and weapons fire 
as would the shields on any card. 
</p><p>Cards that are played to terrain may only be played to Vektrean asteroid 
bases if they cause damage (or if they may also be played to bases). You can 
play a Vektrean asteroid base to a star because it is played as terrain, but you 
may not play a white dwarf to the Vektrean asteroid base, because it is a base 
for purposes other than being played and damaged. 
</p><p>Vektrean asteroid bases may be used by any deck, but must be supported using 
the rules for supporting minor empire cards (unless used in a Vektrean deck). 
They are Vektrean and may use Vektrean technology. They may not use adapted 
technology (this is limited to their ships). 
</p><p><b>T/S2 Vektrean Asteroid Freighter (errata):</b> This card may not be 
combined with terrain. 
</p><p><b>T6 Out of Phase World (TG/nc):</b> When the out of phase world is out of 
phase, the terrain stack is considered removed from play. This terrain may only 
change phase during the Allocation Phase (and is therefore "in phase" on the 
turn played). 
</p><p><b>T6 System - Femerazi System:</b> This affects all Tufor ships in play in 
all fleets. 
</p><p><b>T/B6 Vektrean Asteroid Station:</b> This card was reprinted in Piracy and 
now has six shields. See "T/B5 Vektrean Asteroid Outpost" in this section for 
the rules for Vektrean asteroid bases. 
</p><p><b>T7 Planet Krebizar:</b> This planet affects Krebiz capsules in play in all 
fleets. This includes capsules combined with cruisers. 
</p><p><b>T8 System - Mechad System:</b> This affects all Mechad ships in all 
fleets. 
</p><p><b>T8 Plasmatic Nebula:</b> This nebula affects all P.O.T. ships in all 
fleets. 
</p><p><b>T9 Planet - Corporate Homeworld:</b> This affects all Corporate ships in 
all fleets. 
</p><p><b>T/B9 Vektrean Asteroid Starbase:</b> See "T/B5 Vektrean Asteroid Outpost" 
in this section for clarification on the rules for Vektrean asteroid bases.
