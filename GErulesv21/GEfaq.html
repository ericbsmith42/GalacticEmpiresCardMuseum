		<h1 id="PLAYINGCARDS" class="QA">Playing Cards</h1>
	</div>
	<div id="HowCards" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>How are cards played (engaged or disengaged):</b> 
			Cards with an engagement cost are played disengaged. Cards without an engagement cost 
			are played engaged.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			Two exceptions are abilities and non-passive equipment. These are always
			played disengaged when being played to a disengaged card.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			Anything that affects the engagement cost of cards in the fleet has no effect
			on how that card is played. Cards which specify that their engagement cost
			varies by location (or other effect) are played either engaged or disengaged
			based on the engagement cost at the location (or other effect) to which they are
			being played.
		</p>
	</div></div>


	<div id="WhereCards" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>Where are cards played:</b> Where cards are played is determined by their
			type (ships are played to the fleet or to terrain in the fleet, bases are only
			played to terrain in the fleet, etc.). Some types, however, determine where they
			are played by what is on the card. Cards affecting one or more cards are played
			to or against the affected card or cards. Cards affecting things other than
			cards (weapons fire, opponents' card plays, etc.) are played to the owning
			player's fleet.
		</p>
	</div>


	<div id="WhenCards" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>When can cards be played:</b> Cards are played during your turn during
			either card play phase (Play Cards Phase A or Play Cards Phase B). Certain cards
			exempt themselves from this rule by stating during which phase they are played
			(Example: &quot;Played during the Weapons Fire Phase&quot; or &quot;May be
			played during the Allocation Phase&quot;). In the first example, the card must
			be played during the Weapons Fire Phase. In the second example, the option is
			given to play the card during the Allocation Phase. It may still be played
			during a card play phase if desired.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			Cards with an &quot;R/&quot; before their card type may be played as a
			reaction to an opponent's action as long as the card performs a card action (a
			function stated on the card) or states some rule which is used when played.
			Cards that state &quot;as a reaction,&quot; in their text must be in play to be
			used (unless the card has an &quot;R/&quot; before their card type). The
			following are opponent actions to which you may react: Point Allocation, a card
			being played or placed/moved into play, a card action, weapons fire, and
			discarding during the discard phase. Keep in mind, even though drawing cards is
			not on the list, you can react to a card action used to draw cards, such as a
			cyber mage or quartermaster. See <a href="#WhenPerform">When do cards perform
			their action</a> under <a href="#CARDACTIONS">Card Actions</a>.
		</p>
	</div>


	<div id="TurnOne" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>Turn 1 and 2 Restrictions:</b> Turn 2 begins for all players as soon as
			the first player has begun his/her second turn. Turn 3 begins for each player as
			he/she begins his/her third turn.
		</p>
	</div>


	<div class="sectional"><div class="sectional"><p class="AQ">&nbsp;</p>
		<h1 id="CARDACTIONS" class="QA">Card Actions</h1>
	</div>
	<div id="WhenPerform" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>When do cards perform their action(s):</b> Engaged cards perform their
			actions during their controller's turn during a card play phase (either Play
			Cards Phase A or B). Example: An Evil Temple will destroy the opponent's crew as
			a card action during the temple controller's turn. The exceptions to this are as
			follows.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			Cards played in reaction mode act when played (during any phase or turn).
			They then may perform their actions during their controller's following and
			subsequent turn.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			Cards which state &quot;as a reaction,&quot; may only perform such actions as
			a reaction to an opponent's action (during any phase of any player's turn). Such
			cards must be in play to perform their action and require an &quot;R/&quot; to
			be played in reaction mode.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			Some cards act during a different phase as appropriate. A C4 Temporal
			Mechanic affects the controller's card draw and therefore acts during the Draw
			Cards Phase. Ships firing weapons may only do so during the Weapons Fire Phase.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			Cards played in reaction mode may only fire weapons if played during a
			Weapons Fire Phase.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			Disengaged cards may not perform any actions. Rules on disengaged cards do
			not apply unless they are strictly self-affecting. Rules on an ability card
			disengaged due to the crew being disengaged are considered self-affecting if
			they affect either the ability or the card on which the ability is played. This
			is to say that a disengaged B4 Border Station will not prevent other bases from
			being the target of weapons fire, because rules on disengaged cards do not
			affect other cards. However, a disengaged T3 Crystal Planet (disengaged due to
			an invasion, for example) is still immune to weapons fire because that rule only
			affects the card itself.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			If a card states that another card may not be used or may not function, the
			affected card is treated as if it was disengaged. The card is not, however,
			actually disengaged unless the effect states that it disengages the card.
		</p>
	</div></div>


	<div id="HowManyTimes" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>How many times may cards perform their functions:</b> All engaged cards
			may perform their action(s) once per turn. Disengaged cards may not perform any
			actions.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			Some cards (such as an A6 Promotion, or a C8 Spiritual Leader) allow certain
			cards to perform a function twice. If two such cards are applied to the same
			card, the card would be able to perform two separate functions twice each or a
			single function three times. Please note that weapons fire is not considered a
			function.
		</p>
	</div>


	<div class="sectional"><div class="sectional"><p class="AQ">&nbsp;</p>
		<h1 id="VARIOUSSUBJECTS" class="QA">Various Subjects</h1>
	</div>
	<div id="AbilityCards" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>Ability Cards:</b> Ability cards are played to crew in your fleet unless the ability
			says otherwise.
		</p>
	</div></div>


	<div id="Activated" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>Activated:</b> A card that is activated against another card is affecting that card
			without needing to move against that card. A tractor beam or mine is
			activated against a ship. It is not considered played against the ship.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="AllocationPhase" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>Allocation Phase:</b> The Allocation Phase and the Engagement Phase are separate
			phases. Cards
			which produce points or modify the production of points do so if they will
			be engaged during the Engagement Phase. If they will not be engaged, they do
			not produce or modify points during the Allocation Phase. This allows a card
			to use its own point modification to pay its own engagement cost.
			Essentially, at the end of the Engagement Phase, your output must be
			sufficient to pay for the engagement cost of all cards engaged in the fleet.
			If a player wishes to modify your output with reaction cards, he may do so
			while you are allocating or applying points. You must then recheck your
			points.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			When you are done allocating points, declare what ship systems are loaded
			and what excess points are available (if you plan on applying them). Then
			apply the points. Points may only be applied to each opponent card once
			during the Allocation Phase. If you are required to recheck your point
			output and reallocate, you may reallocate the same number of points (or
			fewer) to an opponent card. You may not use this opportunity to apply more
			points. Reacting to point output early in the phase will solve most
			problems.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			Cards with durations advance in duration at the beginning of the
			Allocation Phase. Cards with durations that affect point output perform
			their point output or modification to point output before being discarded.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="ArmorSystems" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>Armor Systems:</b> Armor systems are a special ship system and are not shields or EMF (and
			are compatible with either). An armor system may be activated any time
			damage is being applied to the structure of a card with an armor system.
			They may not be activated if the damage being applied does not penetrate the
			unit's defenses (shields or EMF). They may not be activated against damage
			which states that it is structural (such as a boarding party attack). Only
			normal (not direct structural) damage which reaches the structure (causing
			structural damage) may be prevented by the use of an armor system.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			An armor system may only be activated once against each source of damage.
			A single weapons volley from multiple sources is considered one source of
			damage. Armor systems function, regardless of whether the unit is engaged or
			disengaged. Every time an armor system is activated, it prevents an amount
			of damage from being applied to the structure equal to its current strength.
			In doing this, the system loses a single point of strength. Armor systems
			may not be repaired.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="Auctions" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>Auctions:</b> When a card requires an auction of points (usually economy), players may
			bid an amount of points up to the amount they would produce as if it were
			currently their Allocation Phase. They may not include any point
			modification from cards not currently engaged. They may not use the point
			output of cards prevented from producing points (even if they will be able
			to produce points by their next Allocation Phase).
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			The winner of the auction has his bid subtracted from his point output of
			his next Allocation Phase. If all points bid are not paid (possibly due to
			some effect after the auction), remaining points due must be paid on his
			following Allocation Phase. Any cards which consume points receive their
			points before any debt is paid. Any current debt must be taken into account
			if another auction is held.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="Bases" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>Bases:</b> Bases can fire at any standard target (including other bases or terrain).
			They may not fire at a Sector HQ or Psy Network. Bases are not designated as
			ground or orbital. Any references to orbiting bases simply refers to bases
			on the terrain, unless the card states to see the illustration. For these
			cases, if you see the base floating in space, it is orbital; otherwise, it
			is not.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="Basisofastack" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>Basis of a stack:</b> A card is considered the basis of a stack any time there is one or more
			cards played to or against it. Any card with the phrase &quot;may not be
			played to the basis of a stack&quot; will be voided if the card becomes the
			basis of a stack before its effects are resolved.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="Bids" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>Bids:</b> See <a href="#Auctions">Auctions</a> in this section for the rules for bidding points.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="CardDamage" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>Card Damage:</b> Card damage is any damage from a source other than weapons fire. The
			important distinction between the two types of damage is that card damage
			that is applied to the structure of terrain may not be repaired by repair
			points unless the source of these points states they may be used to repair
			card damage. Please note that only cards which specifically state they
			damage terrain may apply card damage to the structure of terrain.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="CardName" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>Card Name:</b> The title of a card includes the name above the illustration and below the
			illustration. The T5 Planet - Candor II is not considered the same identical
			card as the T5 Planet - Zambarez Planet.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="CardStrength" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>Card Strength:</b> A card's strength is the number located in the upper left corner of the
			card. When there are two numbers separated by a slash, the first is the
			fleet strength (the card's strength when not in the time origin) and the
			second is the origin strength. Any card with a split strength goes to the
			time origin when discarded from the fleet. Damage applied to the structure
			of a card does not affect its strength, only its current strength (see
			<a href="#CurrentStrength">Current Strength</a> in this section). Only cards that state they
			affect the strength of a card modify a card's strength.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="Combined" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>Combined:</b> Whenever two or more cards become combined, they are treated as one card
			of the appropriate type. The strengths of the two cards are added to
			determine the strength of the combined card. Any shields and weapons are
			considered added together, forming one set of weapons and one shield. The
			point output is combined (and therefore may be modified as a whole).
			Functions and rules are not combined. Immunities only apply to the points
			contributed by the immune card. The cards are considered two different
			cards, with one card being played to the other for the purposes of cards
			that affect a single card or stack of cards. This is to say, a T6 Vorn with
			a T4 White Dwarf is 1 terrain for terrain affecting cards such as O7
			Interplanetary Conflict, but is a T4 on a T6 for cards such as R/L8 Vacuum
			Effect.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			Cards are only combined while in play. Combined cards which are moved to
			the reserve fleet, the hand, or the Discard Pile will become separate cards.
			As an example, when an S1 Patrol Ship combined with an S7 Patrol Ship
			Courier is destroyed, the patrol ship would be returned to the hand and the
			courier would be discarded.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			When two cards are combined, any damage applied to either card is
			considered damage applied to the combined cards. The type of damage does not
			change. Structural damage must remain structural (the same goes for shield
			damage). When combined cards are separated, the damage may be divided
			between the two. However, structural damage may not be applied to either
			card in excess of its strength (the same applies to shield damage).
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			Combined cards require a command slot based on a single card of the
			combined strength. A strength six ship (requiring one command slot) combined
			with a strength two ship (requiring one half of a command slot) becomes a
			strength eight ship (requiring one command slot).
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			If an effect (certain fields) allows parts of a combined card to be
			damaged separately, any currently existing damage must be divided (as if the
			parts were separating).
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="CommandPointsSlots" class="sectional">
		<p class="QB">
			<b>Command Points/Slots:</b> Like all points, command points are only generated during the Allocation
			Phase. These points are converted into command slots for any cards in play
			which consume a command slot (or half of a slot). Any excess points not
			needed for command slots may be used to engage cards requiring a command
			point to engage (time knights). Once this is done, any unused points are
			converted into command slots. Points not used during the Allocation Phase
			are lost, but command points not used are always turned into command slots.
			Command slots last one complete turn (or until occupied).
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			If you do not generate enough command points to provide a command slot

			In addition to not being able to generate more EMF than twice the

			limits will be sixteen and nineteen. Since both limits apply, the lower
			limit may not be exceeded.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			EMF absorbs damage in a similar manner to shields. It will not absorb
			damage stated as structural. Damage which bypasses shields must also state

		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			The strength of a unit's EMF is indicated by one or more dice. When

			During the Allocation Phase, EMF on units in the fleet is not repaired, it
			is generated anew.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			EMF is generated through the use of nodes. Only a card with nodes may
			generate EMF. Cards with nodes may not have shield refits applied to them.
		</p>
		<p class="QB">
			If a card with nodes is not engaged during the Allocation Phase, it has
			an EMF strength equal to the strength of the unit. EMF may not be increased
