			<b>Q:</b> A5 Temporal Comprehension says that it &quot;may perform its card actions
				twice each turn, once during each Card Play phase.&quot; If this card is layed
				to a Dragon, can the Dragon fire it's weapons twice, since a weapon's fire is
				considered an action, isn't it? Or can it only perform actions twice which
				normally take place on a card play phase as opposed to the weapons fire phase?
		</p>
		<p class="QA">
			<b>A:</b> Actually, Weapons fire is not really considered a Card Action for this
				purpose, because it occurs in its own phase, so the answer is functions that
				are done in a card play phase can be done in each card play phase.</li>

		</p>
		<p class="QA">
			<b>A:</b> Yes. Each one can create its own stack, or can be part of the same stack.
				So, you could have a T9 Gas Giant with a R/B8 Citadel, and a few crew cards as
				one stack, a B7 Academy as a seperate stack on the T9, and a B9 Starbase with
				a B3 Heavy Planetary Shield, and some more crew as a third stack on the T9.
				Remember though, this kind of terrain stacking becomes a major target.

			<b>Q:</b> Does the B1 Military Outpost have to be engaged to produce the extra Economy

		</p>
		<p class="QA">
			<b>A:</b> You play it to one of your ships to do damage to another ship. The Tufor's

			<b>Q:</b> Suppose I have a ship that has 5 Phasers and 3 Heavy Weapons, can I split
				the fire onto Multiple targets. I.e., can I fire 3 phasers against one unit
				and 2 phasers and 3 heavy weapons against another? Also, if I have 2 ships
				that I want to fire against a unit, do they fire at the same time, or can 1
				ship fire it's weapons first, then fire some of its weapons against another
				unit and then have the 2nd ship fire its weapons against the first unit that
				the 1st ship fired on.
		</p>
		<p class="QA">
			<b>A:</b> Yes you could fire at eight different targets if you wanted too. When you
				fire at a target the total fire at that target is a volley. This is true
				whether it comes from one ship, two ships, a ship, and a base, or whatever.
				This is an important concept in the game. The reason it is important is this.
				As a defending player I know you can fire one volley at each target in my
				fleet each turn. This allows me to have a defensive stratedgy. For example: I
				have a S2 Vektrean Frigate, and a S4 Vektrean Light Cruiser. In my hand I have
				a R/L2 Phaser Malfunction Card. You first fire four phasers at my Frigate
				destroying it. I allow this to happen. You then fire 2 heavy weapons, and five
				phasers from two different locations. Let's say that three phasers came from
				one location. I play the R/L2 Phaser Malfunction to that unit. My Light
				Cruiser sustains four hits, two heavy, and two phasers. You cannot fire at the
				Light Cruiser again. I have nothing left you can fire at because you cannot
				fire at my Sector HQ even if you have twenty points of damage you can do. It
				is defended by my Light Cruiser.

				Astral Dragoness by 4. What will the current strength of the D6 Astral
				Dragoness be after all of this...3 (7-4) or 2 (6-4). I would say that since it

				opponent have to play a card first or do an action in order for me to lay a
				reaction card?
		</p>
		<p class="QA">
			<b>A:</b> Well, for instance R/L4 Repair Malfunction is played in reaction to someone
				repairing a ship. In other words, reaction cards can be played in reaction to
				anything, pretty much anytime, unless the card says it must be played at a
				specific time. How many can you play? How many do you have in your hand.
		</p>
		<p class="QA">
			<b>Q:</b> Can I lay a reaction card (on someone else's turn) even if it not reacting
				to anything (i.e., opponent has done anything yet). Does the reaction card
				that I lay in reaction to an opponent's action, have to effect the action of
				the opponent, or can the reaction card affect something else? I.e., if my
				opponent lays a Hazard against one of my bases, can I play a reaction card to
				heal a ship?
		</p>
		<p class="QA">
			<b>A:</b> A reaction card can be played in reaction to any action. Allocating,
				repairing, firing, playing cards, etc. It does not have to be played against a
				specific thing unless the card states it does. So for example, someones Sector
				HQ is open to attack, you could play a R/S1 Ship form the Future as a reaction
				to another players card play, and fire the four phasers at the Sector HQ.

		</p>
		<p class="QA">
			<b>A:</b> Dragons count as a subset of ships for the purpose of stocking minor empire
				ships/dragons. However, 'D' Dragon cards are a separate type of card from 'S' Ship
				cards, so you would need to stock 'S' Ship cards starting at S1 and counting up,
				just like any other card type.

			<b>Q:</b> If I am playing the Dragon Empire and I am stocking my deck and I have a

				with S1,2,3 etc?
		</p>

			<b>A:</b> You are using dragons as a major race, so ships even generic ones, can not

				To differentiate, a R/O1 Time Skip says until the next persons allocation
