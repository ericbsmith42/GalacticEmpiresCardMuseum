<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why am I working on the revision v2.1? There
are quite a few rule additions that were never included in the Universe v2.0 rulebook,
including all information on the <a href="#AlliedEmpires">Allied Forces empires</a>.
Additionally there were optional rules that were dropped from the rulebook along
the way that I've placed back, as well as adding in a few new optional rules. I've
also compiled a brief history of the <a href="#TheSetsAndExpansions">various
expansion sets</a> that were released (and a couple that weren't). I cleaned up the HTML coding from the previous online versions and added
a far more complete Table of Contents. It's important to note that the purpose
of this revision is to <i>collect</i> and <i>organize</i> the rules, not to
change them. I've tried very hard to stick to that goal.
<br>Share and enjoy,

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Far Side of the galaxy, a number of 
galactic empires are fighting for supremacy and survival. These empires include 
numerous races from many different star systems. Galactic Empires is your chance 
to represent the empire of your choice in a battle of wills and wits with 
representatives of other empires. Each empire's history is explained later in 
this rulebook.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Galactic Empires is a science fiction trading card game.
While in command of Sector Headquarters you conquer terrain, deploy bases,
ships, crew and special equipment; and cautiously avoid space monsters, hazards
and other occurrences. The objective: Eliminate your opponents Sector HQs,
conquering the sector and eventually the galaxy.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Game Mechanics:</i> Each players uses his own deck of cards
(Basic Game allows two players to use one deck). There can be as many or as few
cards in the deck as you wish. Each turn consists of applying the output from
your terrain to your bases &amp; ships, playing cards from your hand, firing
weapons and playing more cards
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Cards Themselves:</i> Each card is in dazzling full color
from an assortment of different artists and illustrators. Each card has the
rules needed to operate that ships, system, crew person, etc.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This card game is deceptively simple to learn. Even non-gamers
pick it up quickly. But, more importantly, the game has all the rich flavor and
history of the Far Side of the Galaxy, the strategy of spaceship combat and the
fantastic science fiction flair.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This game will be the easiest, most fun way of introducing
new players to your unique hobby than anything you've ever tried before. And
best of all, you will be able to start play within minutes. Don't be surprised
if you find yourself playing Galactic Empires more than anything else!

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Galactic Empires is a science fiction 
collectible trading card game designed for 2 to 12 players. Each player uses his 
own deck of cards that he has stocked with the cards he wishes to use for that 
game. Rules limit the number and types of cards that a player may use to stock 
his deck for a game. New cards are added within each new expansion.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each player is vying for control over the same sector of space and has 
established a Sector Headquarters (Sector HQ) in that sector. Players deploy 
starships (play cards) in order to protect their Sector HQ and destroy the 
Sector HQs of their opponents. Terrain is required to produce the supply and 
energy needed to operate the ships (allocation and engagement). If a player's 
Sector HQ is destroyed he is no longer capable of controlling his fleet (all his 
cards are removed from play). Play continues until only a single player remains.

<h3 align="center"><a class="SubHead" name="CrucialRules">CRUCIAL RULES</a> <a href="#ToC"><br>Return to the Table of Contents</a></h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following four rules are the cause of the majority of 
rules questions received by Companion Games, Inc. Players who concentrate on 
learning these four rules will have a very clear understanding of Galactic 
Empires. 
</p>

<p>
<a class="SubHead"><b>CARDS HAVE RULES:</b></a> This is the most important rule in the game! Most of the 
cards have rules defined on them. The rules on the cards may contradict the rules contained in this rulebook. In that event, the
rules on the cards take precedence. Most often, reading the cards when
an obscure situation occurs will resolve the situation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Rules on the cards are indicated with a '-'. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Flavor text does not have a dash and is not considered rules. 
</p>

<p>
<a class="SubHead"><b>LAST REACTION CARD PLAYED HAS PRECEDENCE:</b></a> This is the second most important 
rule. In a reaction sequence, the most recently played reaction&nbsp; card will take its action(s) before previously
played reaction cards. 
</p>

<p>
<a class="SubHead"><b>PLAYER TURN SEQUENCE:</b></a> 
Players who follow the 7 phases of the player turn 
sequence closely during the first few games will learn quickly
and develop a good insight into tactics. Each turn of Galactic Empires
is played in a linear fashion, one phase at a time. Once a phase is
completed
and a player has moved on to the next phase he cannot return to a
previous phase. 
</p>

<p>
<a class="SubHead"><b>LIMIT ON CARD ACTIONS:</b></a> 
Cards in play may only perform each of their functions 
once per complete turn (from the point of view of the
controlling player). Additionally, functions of a card used as a
reaction may only by used once per complete turn.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All cards have information on them in specific places:
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="CARDTYPE">CARD TYPE</a>:</b> A card's type is the letter in the top left corner of the
card. '<a class="SubHead">T</a>'=Terrain, '<a class="SubHead">S</a>'=Ship, etc. Occasionally a card will have 2 card types (such
as '<a class="SubHead">T/H</a>', '<a class="SubHead">T/B</'>, but not '</a><a class="SubHead">R/</a>'). In this case the card is considered only one of those
card types (player's choice) for purposes of stocking a deck.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="CARDSTRENGTH">CARD STRENGTH</a>:</b> The strength of a card is the number in the top left
corner of the card next to its card type. Strength ranges from 1 to 10. Some
cards have two strengths; see the rules for the <a href="#TimeGatesRules">Time
Origin</a> and <a href="#AQAARAN">Aqaarans</a> for details.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="POINTREQUIREMENTS">POINT REQUIREMENTS</a>:</b> (Engagement Cost) The <a href="#ExplanationOfKindsOfPoints">symbols</a> listed immediately
after the type and strength. These are the points required to engage that card.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="CARDTITLE">CARD TITLE</a>:</b> The card title is the name of the card shown above the
illustration and often repeated below. When the title below the illustration
differs from the title above, both are considered part of the cards title (e.g. Twin Planets - Verkish I &amp; II).
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="GENERATEDPOINTS">GENERATED POINTS</a>:</b> Point <a href="#ExplanationOfKindsOfPoints">symbols</a> 
on the top right of the card are points generated by that card each turn (<i>Beginner's
Note: Cards from Alpha & Beta Editions generally had generated point symbols in the top right corner. A few cards from the Primary Edition also have point symbols at the top right
that are not actually generated points (e.g. </i><a class="SubHead">E3 Heavy Weapons Refit</a><i>). As usual, use these cards by the rules of the version that appears in later
printings</i>).
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="SHIELDSNODESARMORSYSTEMS">SHIELDS/NODES/ARMOR SYSTEMS</a>:</b> Also on the top right,
<a href="#SHIELD">Shields</a>,
<a href="#NODE">Nodes</a>, and <a href="#ARMORSYSTEMINDICATOR">Armor Systems</a>
protect the card from damage. These are not generated points.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="FLEETMODIFIERPOINTS">FLEET MODIFIER POINTS</a>:</b> The <a href="#ExplanationOfKindsOfPoints">symbols</a> 
above the illustration on the right, preceded by a mathematical symbol (such as
-&#10061;&#10061;&#10061;)
are modifications to the points produced by a fleet. This is always explained in
the card's rules. These symbols are found in the same place as generated points.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="CARDMODIFIERPOINTS">CARD MODIFIER POINTS</a>:</b> The <a href="#ExplanationOfKindsOfPoints">symbols</a> 
below the illustration on the right are modifications to another card. These are
almost always explained in the card's rules. If not explained in the card's
rules these modifiers are applied to the card's location.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="CARDRULES">CARD RULES</a>:</b> The rules of that card listed below the illustration and
preceded by a &quot;-&quot;.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="WEAPONSYMBOLS">WEAPON SYMBOLS</a>:</b> Some cards have <a href="#OtherKindsOfPoints">weapon symbols</a>
on the bottom of the card.</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginner's Note: Skip this section for now and proceed to
the <a href="#ReserveFleet">Reserve Fleet</a>.</i> 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each player will play with his own deck and must stock that deck with cards 
based on the rules given below. During the game, each player draws only from his 
own deck and maintains his own Discard Pile. 
</p>
<p>
<b><a class="SubHead" name="AnnounceDeckEmpire">ANNOUNCE DECK EMPIRE</a>:</b> Players may stock their decks with cards from only one 
main empire. (Note that a major or minor empire may be used as the main empire 
of a deck if desired.) The empire you will stock your deck with is announced to 
all the other players before decks are stocked for the game. 
</p>
<p>
<b><a class="SubHead" name="StockingTheDeck">STOCKING THE DECK</a>:</b> Each player selects which cards he wishes to use from his 
collection after learning the empire(s) of his opponent(s). Most players have a 
deck ready and merely need to insert several empire specific defensive cards or 
simply use their deck as is. 
</p>
<p>
<b><a class="SubHead" name="NumberOfCardsAndType">NUMBER OF CARDS AND TYPE</a>:</b> Any number of cards and types of those cards may be 
used within the following guidelines: 
</p>
<ol>
 <li> The total deck must consist of at least 40 cards.</li>
 <li> There are different card types: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, O, P, 
Q, S, T and possibly others (but not R/&nbsp;: A reaction card is always considered to 
be a card of the type designated by the other letter on the card). There must be 
at least 8 different card types in a deck and 5 cards of each of those 8 types. 
More than 8 different card types may be used and the 9th and subsequent card 
types are not restricted by the minimum 5 cards per type rule (therefore, as few 
as one card of each of these card types may be used).</li>
 <li> For each card type in the deck there must be at least 1 card of each 
strength up to the highest strength card of that type in the deck. EXAMPLE: If a 
player wishes to place one or more S6 ship cards in his deck he must also have 
at least five other ship cards, one each of strength 1-5. One each of strength 
1-5 is sufficient no matter how many S6 ships were to be used.</li>
 <li> Players are allowed 1/2 of an <a class="SubHead" name="EXCEPTION">exception</a>
to #3 for every 25 cards in a deck. This means that a 150-199 card deck would be
allowed the former standard 3 exceptions. EXAMPLE: A player 
has an M9 he wishes to use but does not have an M8 or an M7. He can use the M9 
as one of the three exceptions to rule #3. An M8 or another M9 would count as a 
second exception, i.e. each card past a gap is an exception. The gap itself is 
not considered an exception.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: The original v2.0 rulebook allowed 3 exceptions no matter the deck size.
  The official Tournament Rules (presented above) from <a href="GalacticFire/GalacticFire3.pdf">Galactic Fire
  #3</a> superseded that rule.</li>
 <li>STRENGTH LEVELS: 
<br>- For every 25 cards in the deck, 1 may be a strength 
10 card (e.g. 25-49=1; 50-74=2; etc.). Each strength 10 card in the deck must be 
a different card. 
<br>- No more than 2 exactly identical cards of strength 9 or 
8 may be used. 
<br>- No more than 3 exactly identical cards of strength 7 or 6 
may be used. 
<br>- No more than 4 exactly identical cards of strength 5 or 4 may 
be used. 
<br>- No more than 8 exactly identical cards of strength 3, 2 or 1 may 
be used. 
<br>- For purposes of stocking a deck, two cards are defined as being 
"exactly identical" if they have the same card type, card strength and card name 
(both above and below the illustration). Additionally, Vektrean asteroid bases 
are considered exactly identical whether they have a '<a class="SubHead">T</a>' or '<a class="SubHead">T/B</a>'. Different 
language versions of the same card are considered exactly identical to each 
other. The pictured image and precise text is not necessarily the same for 
exactly identical cards due to possible changes between print runs and editions 
of the game.</li>
 <li>See also <a href="#TechnologySlotRules">Technology Slot Rules</a>. <i>Beginner's
  Note: Most beginners' can safely ignore the Technology Slot rules, especially if they do not
  possess any <a href="#Promo">Promotional</a> cards.</i></li>
</ol>
<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="UsingMajorEmpireCards">USING MAJOR EMPIRE CARDS</a>:</b> As stated in the
<a href="#AnnounceDeckEmpire">Announce Deck Empire</a> section 
above, players may stock their decks with cards from only one major empire. 
Empire cards are defined as cards with an empire's name in the card's title as 
well as ships, bases, dragons, psys and installations with an empire's color 
texture (the art pattern behind the text). Note that other card types with an 
empire background must have the empire's name in their title to be considered a 
card of that empire. 
</p>
<p>
<b><a class="SubHead" name="UsingMinorEmpireCards">USING MINOR EMPIRE CARDS</a>:</b> A player may use a maximum of
1 minor empire card 
in their deck for each every 4 cards of the same type that are not a minor 
empire card.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If playing a minor empire as the main deck empire, cards belonging to that empire don't need to be supported and in fact can be
used to support minor
empire cards belonging to other minor empires.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Generic ships stocked in a deck do not count for the purposes of this rule. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - For this purpose only, <a href="#INDIRIGANNOMADTRIBES">Indirigan
Tribe</a> cards (Indirigan Nomads, Nagiridni Pirate ships, Indirigan Females, 
etc.) count as only 1/2 a card (do not drop fractions here).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - For this purpose only, <i> when stocked in a deck of the empire they're allied
with,</i> <a href="#AlliedClassRules">Allied</a> cards
count as 1/2 a card and they support non-allied minor empire cards. EXAMPLE: If you have 8 <a href="#TUFORPROTECTORATE">Tufor</a>
ships you may stock 4 <a href="#ERODI">Erodi</a> ships. Those 4 <a href="#ERODI">Erodi</a>
ships would allow you to stock 1 additional non-allied minor empire ship.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- '<a class="SubHead">D</a>' dragon cards are considered to be the  same type as '<a class="SubHead">S</a>' ship cards for the purpose of 
using minor empire ships/dragons (<i>Beginner's Note: '<a class="SubHead">D</a>' dragon cards are still
a separate card type from '<a class="SubHead">S</a>' ship cards for the purposes of the <a href="#NumberOfCardsAndType">Number
of Cards And Types</a> rules above</i>).
<br><a class="SubHead"><b>Optional Rule:</b></a> '<a class="SubHead">I</a>' installation cards (<a href="#COMEDYCLUBNETWORK">Comedy
Clubs</a>) and '<a class="SubHead">P</a>' psy cards
can be used to support '<a class="SubHead">S</a>' ship and '<a class="SubHead">D</a>' dragon minor empire cards.
<br><a class="SubHead"><b>Optional Rule:</b></a> Rather than supporting minor empire cards with cards of the
<i> same type</i>, count <i>all</i> of the main empire cards in the deck
and allow them to support minor empire cards of <i> any type</i>. This will limit the
total number of minor empire cards a player can use, but will better balance the
number of main empire cards against the number of minor empire cards.

<h3 align="center"><a class="SubHead" name="ReserveFleet">RESERVE FLEET
<br> </a><a href="#ToC">Return to the Table of Contents</a></h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reserve fleet is a number of cards
that can be brought into play more or 
less at will, without having to rely on the luck of the draw from the deck. 
</p>

<p>
<b><a class="SubHead" name="CreatingTheReserveFleet">CREATING THE RESERVE FLEET</a>:</b> Remove a number of cards of any type from your 
deck equal to or less than the number of players at the start of the game. These 
may be any cards of any type of your choice selected from the deck. They are set 
aside, face down and are not exposed to the other players until after the ante 
has been drawn.
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i> <i>Beginner's Note: A <a class="SubHead">T4</a>, <a class="SubHead">S3</a>, <a class="SubHead">T5</a>, <a class="SubHead">S4</a>, <a class="SubHead">R/C4</a> ... (or cards that are close in strength to these).</i> 
</p>

<p>
<b><a class="SubHead" name="UsingTheReserveFleet">USING THE RESERVE FLEET</a>:</b> As a Card Play, a player may swap a card from his 
hand with a card in his reserve fleet. The card placed into the reserve fleet 
must be of equal or higher strength then the card removed. The removed card is 
placed into the hand. This swap counts as 1 of the Card Plays that a player may 
make on his turn. To play this card from the player's hand to his active fleet 
requires another second Card Play.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the reserve fleet will always contain a number of cards equal to 
the number it contained at the beginning of the game, since a card must be 
played into the reserve fleet in order to remove a card from it. 
</p>

<p>
<b><a class="SubHead" name="ReserveFleetRestrictions">RESERVE FLEET RESTRICTIONS</a>:</b> Cards with the word 'reserve' in the title and 
cards that are restricted to one copy per deck (by whatever game rules are 
being used) cannot be placed into the reserve fleet at the start of a game. 
Cards that are restricted to one copy per deck (by whatever game rules are 
being used) cannot be placed into the reserve fleet.

<h3 align="center"><a class="SubHead" name="GettingStarted/Ante">GETTING STARTED/ANTE</a><a href="#ToC"><br>Return to the Table of Contents</a></h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After you have stocked your deck and created your reserve fleet, shuffle the 
remaining cards in your deck. Then set it down in front of you. Any player may 
shuffle your deck. The player to your left then cuts your deck. After all decks 
have been cut each player draws the top card from his deck and exposes it. This 
card is the ante.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The player with the highest strength ante goes first. The second highest 
ante goes second, third highest third, etc. Ties are resolved by die roll. It is 
best for players to seat themselves in a clockwise rotation around the table in 
the order of play. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Each player's ante becomes the first card in his Discard 
Pile.
<br><a class="SubHead"><b>Optional Rule:</b></a> The winner of the game gets to keep all of the ante cards 
after he has won the game. In this case, the ante cards are set aside, not 
placed into the Discard Piles. All players must agree to use this rule before 
play begins. 
</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a class="SubHead" name="HowToWin">HOW TO WIN</a><a href="#ToC"><br>Return to the Table of Contents</a></h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The object of the game is to have fun. To win you must be the last remaining 
player. Once an opponent has sustained 25 points of damage to his Sector HQ he 
is removed from play the game.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an opponent is removed from play the game, all his cards are removed 
from play. Any card played to or against that player is placed on the owner's 
Discard Pile unless that card says it can affect multiple fleets or is able to 
move to new targets in different fleets.
<br><a class="SubHead"><b>VICTORY CELEBRATION:</b></a> Any time a player scores 6 or more points of damage on 
another player's Sector HQ with weapons fire, that player may immediately draw 1 
card from the deck to add to his hand. (It's amazing what your civilians will do 
for you when you are winning the war.).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Players may wish to alter the victory conditions so that the first player to 
cause 50 points of Sector HQ damage to any Sector HQs wins. This way all players 
can play to the end of the game.

<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a class="SubHead" name="BeginningPlay">BEGINNING PLAY</a><a href="#ToC"><br>Return to the Table of Contents</a></h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - After the ante has been drawn, all players expose their reserve fleets to 
the other players by placing them face up on the table in an area designated for 
the reserve fleet. Care should be taken not to confuse the reserve fleet with 
the active fleet that will be formed by playing cards. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - All players draw 9 
cards from their decks. The first player begins his turn by following the Player 
Turn Sequence. When finished, the second player goes and so on.

<p><a class="SubHead"><b>COMPLETE TURN:</b></a> A complete turn is from the beginning of a player's turn to 
the beginning of their next turn. Players keep track of the duration of their 
own cards during their Allocation Phase. A complete turn is one player turn for 
each player, i.e. once around the table. For cards with a duration a complete 
turn starts when the card is played and lasts until the Engagement Phase of the 
next turn of the player who played it. When a card uses the word 'turn' it 
refers to a complete turn.

RECORD KEEPING STEP</a>: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Previously played cards whose duration's
have 
expired are discarded at this time as the first action of this phase. Psy 
functions whose duration's have expired deactivate. Cards that produce or modify 
point output generate their effect before being discarded (EXAMPLE: a periodic comet 
will produce its research on its last turn). 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - All Shields regenerate 1 point during this phase at 
no cost, i.e. one damage point is removed from the Shields of each card with 
damaged Shields in the player's fleet.
<br><a class="SubHead" name="ALLOCATION">ALLOCATION</a>: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terrain and some other cards generate points. Generated 
points are allocated to other cards as desired by the owning player. Points must 
be allocated to cards each turn. All such point allocation occurs only in the 
Allocation Phase.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Only a card that will receive all of its 
point requirements may receive additional points for the operation of heavy 
weapons, ship systems or equipment. However, crew cards on disengaged cards can 
receive points. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Points that are not used during the Allocation Phase are 
lost. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Cards that have point requirements and generate points will 
generate points if they will be engaged. Cards that modify point output will 
modify point output if they will be engaged. Cards that will not be engaged 
cannot generate or modify points.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the sake of player convenience, the Engagement Phase may be merged with 
the Allocation Phase since it is easier to allocate to one card, engage it and

before any weapons volleys are declared. These weapons affect all of a given
type or types of targets in the targeted fleet (read the weapon descriptions for
details). They are <i>not</i> considered a weapons volley, but are resolved
similarly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a class="SubHead" name="WEAPONSVOLLEY">WEAPONS VOLLEY</a>: Each weapons
volley consists of 5 steps:
<br>a - Declare weapons fire to a single target (card or stack of cards) from any 
number of engaged cards in the firing player's fleet with one or more unfired 
weapons. This is a weapons volley.
<br>b - Players may play reaction cards in 
reaction mode. The firing player cannot react unless another player has reacted. 

<br>c - Resolve the effect of reaction cards.
<br>d - Resolve 
the effects of the weapons volley, i.e. target destroyed or damaged, etc. 
<br>e - Repeat the above sequence, declaring weapon volleys to new 
targets until there are no more targets or there are no more weapons to fire. A

 - Remaining unused Card Plays may be used to discard cards from the hand. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A player may discard any number of cards from his active fleet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Cards that are yours but under the controll of another player or cards that you 
cannot control because of the effect of a card played against that card may not 
be voluntarily discarded (not even by that other player) until you regain 
control. Note, this card could indirectly be discarded by discarding the basis 
of the stack to which it is played. EXAMPLE: A C9 Admiral with an O9 Insanity 
played against it may not be discarded, however the B4 Base Station on which the 
C9 Admiral is played may be discarded, thereby discarding the insane admiral.

the player has 12 or more cards in his hand, he draws 0 cards from the deck.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If there are no more cards in the deck the player cannot draw cards, i.e. 
the Discard Pile is not reshuffled.

advises the next player that he is finished.

something, it is too late to go back to an earlier phase in the sequence of play 
and do something there. Mistakes happen and you will make mistakes. When 
learning it is OK to go back and redo things, but when playing on a competitive 
level you will be expected to go on when you make a mistake, sacrificing the 
portions of your turn you forgot to use.

elsewhere in play) are played in the disengaged position. Cards without point 
requirements are played engaged. Cards are not considered to be in play until 
after they have been played.
<br><i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginner's Note: Since point allocation is the first phase of the player

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A disengaged card may not take any action. Cards may be played to disengaged 
cards, opponents may score weapons damage on them, etc. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A disengaged ship or base can only operate its Shields, conduct repairs by 
use of repair points and operate passive equipment. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Engaged cards on disengaged cards function. The only exceptions are that 
crew must be engaged to use an ability card and non-passive equipment on a 
disengaged unit must be disengaged. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Rules on a disengaged card may still affect the disengaged card. Rules such 
as how the card is destroyed, specific immunities, etc. are not affected by 
being disengaged.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a card is played it cannot change location unless a rule on that or

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A there-and-back mission is a means for crew cards to assault an opponent 
location by transporting to that location with a shuttle, fighter or 
transporter, making an attack and transporting back. There-and-back missions are 
a 3 step process: 
</p>

<p><a class="SubHead"><b>1- TRAVEL THERE:</b></a>  The transport to the target location. 
<br><a class="SubHead"><b>2- THE MISSION:</b></a> 
The crew's card action (<i>Beginner's Note: many crew perform functions at their 
location, these crew use equipment to do there-and-back missions to affect 
opponent locations</i>). 
<br><a class="SubHead"><b>3- TRAVEL BACK:</b></a> The transport back.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Any of these 3 steps can be reacted to. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- When played in reaction mode, 
shuttles, fighters and transporters may be played simultaneously with any 
reaction crew card.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Shuttles and fighters travel with the crew, while 
transporters remain at their location.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Any crew card can perform a there-and-back mission to
perform one of its card functions, even if the crew card doesn't explicitly say
it can. EXAMPLE: An R/C7 Doctor can go on a there-and-back mission to negate an
injury or illness at another location.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once played, cards remain in play until the actions of another player cause 
them to be removed from play and discarded (firing weapons, effects of 
occurrence cards, etc.). Some cards are instant and after applying their effects 
are immediately discarded (discarded after use). Some cards last a specific 
amount of turns and are discarded after that many turns have elapsed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Any card that reaches a strength of ZERO is discarded. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- When a card 
is discarded all cards played on or against it are discarded also (except ships 
and dragons in play on destroyed terrain cards and cards played to or against 
several locations). 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Voided Card Plays: Cards that state they are 
discarded after use and which are voided by a reaction card are discarded even 
though they did not get used. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Returned to the Hand: When a stack of cards 
is returned to the hand, each card in the stack is returned to its respective 
owner's hand.

<h3 align="center"><a class="SubHead" name="DiscardPile">DISCARD PILE</a><a href="#ToC"><br>Return to the Table of Contents</a></h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cards placed in the Discard Pile must remain in the order in which they are 
discarded. Some cards require a search through or removal from the Discard Pile 
and so the cards should not be disordered. When cards are discarded as a group 
they may be placed on the Discard Pile in any order, but once in the Discard 
Pile they may not be reorganized. Any player may look through any discard pile at
any time.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cards in play may only perform each of their functions 
once per complete turn (from the point of view of the controlling player). 
Additionally, functions of a card used as a reaction may only be used once per 
complete turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: Cards were always limited to active once per turn. The fact 
that "each turn" was listed on most cards led some people to believe that cards 
without this clause could function multiple times.

<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a class="SubHead" name="PlayingReactionCards">PLAYING REACTION CARDS</a><a href="#ToC"><br>Return to the Table of Contents</a></h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only cards designated with an 'R/' may be played in reaction to an opponent 
player's actions on an opponent's turn. They cannot be played in reaction on 
your own turn unless reacting to an opponent's reaction card play. Reaction card 
actions occur just before the action they are reacting to.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Cards played in reaction do not count against the Card Play limit when 
played during another player's turn. They DO count as a Card Play when played 
during your own turn and may not be played if all Card Plays have already been 
used.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A reaction card may only be played in reaction mode if one of its functions 
is used at the time it is played. Any of the reaction card's functions may be 
used when it is played (regardless of the play phase), except reaction cards can 
only fire their weapons if played in an opponent's Weapons Fire Phase and only 
if those weapons do not need resource points to function.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Cards played in reaction can generate points and apply them to another 
card. They cannot cause that card to engage unless they specifically say so. 
Reaction cards that are not played in reaction mode will not generate points 
outside of the Allocation Phase. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Reaction cards cannot be played in phases 
where the playing player takes no actions. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The following things can be 
reacted to: Point allocation, a card being played, a card action, weapons fire, 
and the discarding of cards during the Discard Phase. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If a card is removed 
from play as a reaction before being resolved, the card will be resolved upon 
returning to play.
<br><a class="SubHead"><b>LAST REACTION CARD PLAYED HAS PRECEDENCE:</b></a>  In a reaction sequence, the most 
recently played REACTION card will take its action(s) before previously played 
reaction cards.

actions in reaction mode even if they are already in play as long as they are

<br>EXAMPLE: Minesweepers (which can prevent an opponent's mine from doing 
damage) and escorts (which can intercept some incoming damage directed at 
certain other ships) may take these actions as if they were played in reaction

POINTS
<br> </a>
<a href="#ToC">Return to the Table of Contents</a></h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A player's fleet has a command limit. The command limit is the maximum number 
of cards that require a command slot that a player may normally have in play.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Cards that consume 1 command slot each include ship, dragon and base cards 
of strength 3 or higher. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Cards that consume 1/2 of a command slot each 
include all psy cards, strength 2 ships, strength 2 dragons and strength 2 
bases. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - No other cards consume command slots. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Combined cards require 
the command slots of their combined strength.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Allocation Phase, each player automatically generates a number of 
command points equal to the number of players that started the game (this does 
not change as players are eliminated). This number, plus any other generated 
command points, is the number of command slots that player has available for 
that complete turn.
<br>EXAMPLE: If there are four players then each player may have up to four cards that
consume command slots in play at any given time. If a player has a ship in 
his hand, but all of his command slots are in use, he may not play it until a 
command slot is available.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Cards that generate command points only do so in the Allocation Phase. 
Therefore, a card just played that generates command points cannot use that 
command point to create a command slot until the Allocation Phase of the next 
turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If a player has full command slots and loses some command points he 
does not have to discard cards that consume command slots, but he may not play 
another card requiring command slots until a free slot becomes available. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Cards that require command points as a point requirement cannot receive command 
points during the Allocation Phase until all other cards occupying a command 
slot have had command points allocated to those slots. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Unused command 
points always create empty command slots for that player. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- When calculating 
the number of command slots used, never drop fractions. 
</p>

<p>
<b><a class="SubHead" name="MinorEmpireCommandRatingBonus">MINOR EMPIRE COMMAND RATING BONUS</a>:</b>  One minor empire ship (but not a generic 
ship) in play in the fleet does not consume a command slot and may be played 
even if all command slots are full. However, if that minor empire is being used 
as the main empire of the player's deck, then ships of that main minor empire do 
not get this benefit.

<h3 align="center"><a class="SubHead" name="Control">CONTROL</a>
<br><a href="#ToC">Return to the Table of Contents</a></h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The owning player controls the actions of his cards unless an opponent has 
assumed control by the means of some card. In order to assume control of an 
opponent's card that requires a command slot, the player assuming control must 
have a command slot available for that card. Once controlled by an opponent that 
card does not occupy a command slot in its original fleet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - On the turn that control of an engaged opponent card is established, that 
card can be used normally if it was engaged when control was established. If a 
controlled card has point requirements the controlling player must allocate 
these points during his Allocation Phase in order to use that card on subsequent 
turns. Phasers on the controlled card can be used normally, but heavy weapons 
can only be used if they were armed (and not used) by the previous controlling 
player. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A controlled ship protects the Sector HQ of the player controlling 
it. A controlled psy protects the Psy Network of the player controlling it. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Control may revert back to the owning player even if there is no command 
slot available.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The card type rules specifically state where that card type is played.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a card is played against an opponent, it is usually best to keep the 
bottom end of the card facing toward the person who owns the card (upside down 
to the affected player) and place a color marker bead on the card. This will 
help to prevent confusion when cards are discarded or otherwise returned to 
their owners if each player is using different color beads.

etc. Try to be consistent; always use red dice for damage to ships and bases and 
monsters, green for Shields, white for applied research points, black for 
permanent damage, etc. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Dice may also be used to keep track of duration on
cards that only last a specific number of turns.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasionally, an interaction between two or more cards might become difficult 
to resolve. This is extremely rare and even if it occurs players should be able 
to come to an agreement about how to resolve the interaction. These interactions 
are resolved by vote and play continues as usual (resolve ties with a die roll).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unresolved interactions will be formally resolved in the Galactic Empires 
bimonthly magazine, Galactic Fire. After resolution in Galactic Fire, votes are 
no longer used. Call Companion Games, Inc. at 1-607-XXX-XXXX to receive your

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many different types of points generated by terrain and other 
cards. The representative symbol is given with each.

<b><a href="#ToC"><br>Return to the Table of Contents</a></b>  

</h3>

<p>&#10061; <b><a class="SubHead" name="ECONOMY">ECONOMY</a>:</b> Economy points are the most 
useful type of points. They can be declared and used as supply points, energy 
points, ammunition points, research points, repair points or healing points. 
During the Allocation Phase of each turn the player declares what his economy 
points will be used for. Each economy point may be used as a different point 
type each turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Economy points are not modified by point modifiers that modify other types 
of points even when the economy points are used as that point type. 
</p>

<p><big>&#9679;</big> <b><a class="SubHead" name="SUPPLY">SUPPLY</a>:
</b> Supply points are consumables 
needed by many cards in order to function. 
</p>

<p>&#10040; <b><a class="SubHead" name="ENERGY">ENERGY</a>:</b> Energy is the power needed for 
operation. 
</p>

<p>&#9724; <b><a class="SubHead" name="AMMUNITION">AMMUNITION</a>:</b> Ammunition points are 
required to fire heavy weapons. The number of heavy weapon points are listed at the 
bottom of some cards by the use of heavy weapon symbols (identical to the 
ammunition symbol). A maximum of 1 ammunition point may be allocated to each of 
these heavy weapons. 
</p>

<p>&#10063; <b><a class="SubHead" name="RESEARCH">RESEARCH</a>:</b> Research points represent 
scientific study. 
</p>
<p>&#9830; <b><a class="SubHead" name="REPAIR">REPAIR</a>:</b> 
Repair points represent the 
ability to fix damage. Each repair point may fix one point of damage. Only a 
card in your active fleet may be fixed with repair points. There are two types 
of repair points, the general repair point and the healing point.
<br><a class="SubHead"><b>Repair Point:</b></a> A repair point may only be used to fix damage to a Shield point 
or a strength point on a ship card (but not a dragon card), or a base card. It 
may also be used to repair damage on a terrain card, but not card damage applied 
to the structure of a terrain card.
<br><a class="SubHead"><b>Healing Point:</b></a> A healing point is always designated by card rules. A healing 
point will 'cure' a point of damage (or applied research points) on a being 
(dragon, psy, monster, etc.). The being type will always be specified on the card 
generating the healing point(s). An economy point used as a healing point may 
NOT be used to heal monsters, but may be used on all other types of beings.

<p>&#10026; <b><a class="SubHead" name="COMMAND">COMMAND</a>:
</b> Command points allow extra 
ships, bases, dragons or psys to be in play. Command points are generated during 
the Allocation Phase. Each command point creates a command slot at that time 
(see command limits). 
</p>

<p>&#10087; <b><a class="SubHead" name="LOBSTER">LOBSTER</a>:</b> Lobster points are found in 
the Comedy Club on the Far Side of the Galaxy expansion. Lobster points 
allocated to a monster equal to the monster's strength disengages the monster 
for one complete turn. 
</p>

<p>&#10006; <b><a class="SubHead" name="DAMAGE">DAMAGE</a>:</b> Damage points cause one 
point of damage each.
<br><b>General Damage Points:</b> They are only found at the top right of cards that 
cause damage. This damage is considered card damage not weapons fire.
<br><b>Weapon Damage Points:</b> This symbol is used to represent several different weapon types 
at the bottom of the card (see the <a href="#GeneralWeaponRules">weapon rules</a> for details on these weapons). 
</p>

<p>&#10023; <b><a class="SubHead" name="SHIELD">SHIELD</a>:
</b> Shield points are found at the 
top right of most ship and base cards. Shields always function (even if the card 
is not engaged). Each Shield point is eliminated by one point of damage. After 
the Shields are gone, the unit may sustain structural damage. One Shield point 
is automatically repaired during the Allocation Phase of a player's turn; any 
number may be repaired with repair points. 
</p>

<p>&#10126; <b><a class="SubHead" name="ARMORSYSTEMINDICATOR">ARMOR
SYSTEM INDICATOR</a>:</b> <a href="#LEOPANCONQUISTADORS">Leopan</a> ships use <a href="#ARMORSYSTEM">Armor Sytems</a>
rather than Shields. Armor System indicators are 
located at the top right of cards equipped with armor. Only one such symbol will 
be present and it will contain a number indicating how many uses of that Armor System
are allowed before the Armor System no longer works. See the <a href="#ARMORSYSTEM">Armor Sytems</a>
rules for a full description of how these work. 
</p>

<p>&#10022; <b><a class="SubHead" name="NODE">NODE</a>:</b> Node points are used only on
<a href="#MECHADHOLDFAST">
Mechad</a> ships. Energy allocated to the <a href="#EMF">Electromagnetic Field (EMF)</a> is multiplied 
by the number of Nodes to determine the Strength of the EMF.
See the <a href="#EMF">EMF</a> rules for a full description of how these work. 
</p>

<p>&#10012; <b><a class="SubHead" name="PHASER">PHASER:</a></b> 
Phaser points are found at the 
bottom of many cards. The number of Phaser points shown indicates how many Phasers the card has. Phasers cannot cause structural damage to terrain (see the
<a href="#Non-HeavyWeapons">
weapon rules</a> for Phasers). Any weapon represented with a Phaser point 
is considered a Phaser regardless of the name used. 
</p>

<p>&#9724; <b><a class="SubHead" name="HEAVYWEAPON">HEAVY
WEAPON</a>:</b> Heavy weapons are different for each empire. For instance, the <a href="#KREBIZCAPITALISTALLIANCE">Krebiz</a> use
Sabots, the
<a href="#ARGONIANFIRSTREPUBLIC">Argonians</a> 
use Energy Fluxes and the Dragons use Breath Weapons. Each heavy weapon requires 
one ammunition point to fire. Heavy weapons can damage terrain (see the <a href="#StandardHeavyWeapons">heavy

<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="BASE">BASE CARDS</a>:</b>  Base cards are designated with a '<a class="SubHead">B</a>'.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A base card must be played on a <a href="#TERRAIN">terrain</a> card. A base cannot be in play 
independent of terrain. The terrain card on which a base is played may not be 
targeted by weapons fire until the base is destroyed. A base will not protect a 
terrain card from card damage. Excess damage applied to a base does not splash 
to the terrain card unless the base is played in reaction mode.

</p>
<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="CREW">CREW CARDS</a>:</b> Crew cards are designated with a '<a class="SubHead">C</a>'.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A crew card is played on a <a href="#SHIP">ship</a>, <a href="#BASE">base</a> or
<a href="#TERRAIN">terrain</a> card. Most crew cards have 
an illustration of a specific empire being, this illustration is only an example 
and does not necessarily mean that the crew card may only be used in a deck of 
that empire. Only crew cards with an empire's name in their title are empire 
crew. See the <a href="#DeckConstruction">deck stocking rules</a>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Crew cards with point requirements may have points allocated to them even if 
their location is disengaged. 
</p>

<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="DRAGON">DRAGON CARDS</a>:</b> Dragon cards are designated with a '<a class="SubHead">D</a>'. Dragon cards are a 
subset of '<a class="SubHead" href="#SHIP">S</a>'<a href="#SHIP">hip</a> cards.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Dragon cards are exactly the same as ship cards except no equipment cards, 
crew cards or occurrence cards may be played to them or against them. Note that 
it is possible for a card action from one of these card types to affect a dragon 
(EXAMPLE: A mine card is an equipment card. It is played on a friendly ship. Its 
card action is to cause damage to an enemy ship. Therefore, it can cause damage 
to a dragon).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Effects that apply to ship cards, including weapons fire, monsters, etc. 
also apply to dragon cards.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Dragon cards can be played independently or on a <a href="#TERRAIN">terrain</a> card. A dragon does 
not block damage to the terrain on which it is played nor is the dragon 
destroyed if the terrain is destroyed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Some dragons may be played to other dragons. When this happens, both dragon 
cards are considered one dragon combining their strength.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - An equipment card may only be played to a <a href="#SHIP">ship</a> or
<a href="#BASE">base</a>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Equipment cards have a small '<a class="SubHead">P</a>' or '<a class="SubHead">NP</a>' beneath the bottom left corner of 
the art window. This indicates whether the card is passive or non-passive. 
Passive equipment is always played in the engaged position. A non-passive 
equipment card without point requirements is played in the same position 
(engaged or disengaged) as the unit to which it is played. A non-passive 
equipment card cannot be engaged on a disengaged unit.
<br><a class="SubHead"><b>EMPIRE SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT:</b></a> Some equipment cards are indicated as being the 
exclusive or foreign technology of a specific empire. These cards may only be 
engaged when in play on a unit of that empire.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Exclusive Technology: Other empires cannot use exclusive technology.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Foreign Technology: Foreign Technology cannot be used by other empires except 
by means of a special card that specifically permits the use of foreign 
technology, such as an engineer, some science officers, etc.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Adapted Technology: Empires defined as being able to 'adapt technology' can 
use foreign technology of other empires normally and may use exclusive 
technology by means of a special card that specifically permits the use of 
foreign technology, such as an engineer, some science officers, etc. (See <a href="#VEKTREANMERCENARIES">

<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="AGENDA">AGENDA CARDS</a>:</b> Agenda cards are designated with a '<a class="SubHead">G</a>'.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Each agenda card has a hidden agenda rule and/or an exposed agenda rule.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Hidden agendas must be accomplished entirely before the agenda card is 
played. When the hidden agenda is accomplished, the agenda card is immediately 
exposed from the hand (not a Card Play) and the benefit is immediately gained.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Exposed agendas are played prior to accomplishing the agenda. Their 
benefit cannot be gained until 1 complete turn after the agenda card has been 
played. After that turn, the benefit is immediately gained when the agenda is 
accomplished. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A player may not accomplish the same agenda twice (two 
exactly identical cards) during a single complete turn. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - When an agenda has 
been accomplished, place it on the Sector HQ (or Psy Network).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A player who accomplishes 25 strength points of agendas immediately has his 
Sector HQ or Psy Network restored to 25 points. At this time, all agenda cards 
on the Sector HQ are discarded. Any player may only do this once per game. 
Subsequent agenda cards are discarded when accomplished.

<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="HAZARD">HAZARD CARDS</a>:</b> Hazard cards are designated with an '<a class="SubHead">H</a>'. Hazards represent the 
dangers of space travel.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Each hazard card indicates where it is played and what its effects are. 
Hazard cards that do not say where they are played, are played to or against 
the card or cards that they affect. Hazards cards that affect things other 
than cards (weapons fire, opponent volleys, etc.) are considered played to the 
owning player's fleet.

<p><b><a href="#TypesOfCards">*</a><a class="SubHead" name="INSTALLATION">INSTALLATION CARDS</a>:
</b>Installation cards are designated with an '<a class="SubHead">I</a>'. The lost empire known 
only as the 'ancients' left gigantic stellar installations throughout the Far 
Side. While attempting to conquer a given sector these
abandoned installations were occasionally used by the various empires.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Installations are played independently. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- They are not considered 
bases.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Crew Complement: The player who plays an installation card is assumed to have 
a 'crew complement' on board the installation equal to the strength of the 
installation card plus the strengths of all of his engaged <a href="#CREW">crew</a> cards in play on 
the installation. All other players have a crew complement equal only to the 
summed strengths of their engaged crew cards in play on that installation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Control: The player with the highest crew complement (ties go to the 
installation player) controls the installation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Transport: Crew cannot be played directly to installations; they must be 
moved (via transportation) to the installation. <a href="#ANCIENT">Ancients</a> ('N' cards) are an 
exception and may be played directly to installations. 
</p>

<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="LUCK">LUCK CARDS</a>:</b>  Luck cards are designated with an '<a class="SubHead">L</a>'. Luck cards deal with lucky 
and unlucky situations.

creatures or beings which live in space and often cause damage to terrain or
starships.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Each monster card defines where it is played, how it works, what damage (if 
any) it causes and how it is killed or negated.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Monsters may only be repaired by cards that generate monster healing points.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - When a monster's location (the card or cards it is affecting) is discarded 
the monster is also discarded.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A monster with multiple locations or which can change locations is not

- Ancients in play on 
an installation may move to another location without transportation once each

<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="SHIP">SHIP CARDS</a>:</b>  Ship cards are designated with an '<a class="SubHead">S</a>'.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - There are two basic types of ship cards: Empire ships and generic ships. 
Empire ships have a specific empire written on them such as Argonian, Bolaar, 
etc. Generic ships (freighters, tugs, etc.) can be used by any empire. Generic 
ships do not have an empire stated on them and have a blue lined background. 
Both types of ship cards work as follows:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Ship cards can be played independently or to a terrain card. A ship does not 
block damage to the terrain on which it is played nor is the ship destroyed if 
the terrain is destroyed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Some ships may be played to other ships. When this happens, both ship cards 
are considered one ship combining their strength, Shields, and weapons. 
</p>

<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="TERRAIN">TERRAIN CARDS</a>:</b> Terrain cards are designated with a '<a class="SubHead">T</a>'.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The main function of terrain cards is to provide resource points. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- The 
only cards that can cause card damage to the structure of terrain cards are 
those cards that specifically state they can damage terrain. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Heavy weapons 
are the only weapons that CAN cause damage to the structure of terrain cards. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Terrain cards are played independently and can become the basis of a 
stack.
<br><a class="SubHead"><b>Terrain Output Modifiers:</b></a>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A number of cards (freighters, tugs, bases etc.) modify the point output of 
terrain cards. Positive additive modifiers are not cumulative; only the greatest 
modifier is used (i.e. a terrain with two freighters, +2 economy each, only gets 
a single +2 modifier). Positive multiplicative modifiers are not cumulative; 
only the greatest modifier is used (i.e. a terrain with a base station, 2x 
supply and a starbase, 3x supply, only gets the 3x modifier not a 6x). 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- 
Always apply additive modifiers first, and then apply multiplicative modifiers. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Some terrain may be played to other terrain. Terrain that combine are 
considered one terrain combining their strength and output. Rules on a specific 
element of a terrain stack do not necessarily apply to the entire stack.
EXAMPLE: A 
<a class="SubHead">T5</a> Ring System played to a <a class="SubHead">T3</a> Crystal Planet (immune to weapons fire) may have 
up to 5 points of heavy weapons damage applied to it It will not be discarded 
until the remaining 3 points are applied to the crystal planet portion as card 
damage.

<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="RULESCARDS">RULES CARDS</a>:</b> Rules cards have no designation and no game effects. 
These cards include the Points Symbol card, the Sector HQ cards included in Universe Edition Starters, and the Rules Cards from Allied Forces. 
They are meant only to be references and cannot be stocked in a deck.</p>

<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="ARMORSYSTEM">ARMOR
SYSTEM</a>:</b> <a href="#LEOPANCONQUISTADORS">Leopan</a> ships use Armor Systems
rather than Shields. <a href="#ARMORSYSTEMINDICATOR">Armor System indicators</a>
(&#10126;) are located at the top right of cards equipped with armor. Only one such symbol will 
be present and it will contain a number indicating how many uses of that Armor System
are allowed before the Armor System no longer works.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Armor Systems may only be used once every time damage would be applied to 
the unit's structure. They may not be used, however, to prevent damage from 
cards or weapons which specifically cause structural damage [<a href="#There-and-BackMissionRules">boarding
parties</a>, <a href="#SHIELDPENETRATIONDEVICE">Shield Penetration Device</a>, <a href="#TARRACPROJECTOR">Tarrac
Projectors</a> (structural portion only), etc.]. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - When an Armor System is used against an opponent volley (or other source 
of damage), the damage applied as structural damage is decreased by the current 
strength of the Armor System. After each use, the Armor System decreases 1 point 
in strength. Use a die to indicate the current strength of the Armor System. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Ships possessing an Armor System are not required to activate it. Armor
Systems are passive and can be activated on engaged or disengaged ships. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- 
Shields are always damaged before Armor Systems can decrease damage. Armor
Systems only affect structural damage. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - All other reductions to opponent 
volleys are applied before Armor Systems may be activated. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Armor Systems 
cannot be repaired.

<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="AUXILIARYSHIELDS">AUXILIARY
SHIELDS</a>:</b> <a href="#TARRA'KI">Tarra'ki</a> ships mount secondary Shield
banks. The stronger Shield bank applies (main bank on
ties). Both regenerate.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: The original rules card doesn't specify, but Shield refits should apply to
both
the primary and secondary Shield banks.
</p>
<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="DRONESPECIALSHIPSYSTEMS">DRONE SPECIAL SHIP SYSTEMS</a>:</b> <a href="#DRONE">Drone</a>
ships use a variety of special ship systems.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Points in parenthesis represent a single system. Multiple
points not in a parenthesis indicate multiple systems that may be used
separately.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="DEFLECTORGRID">Deflector Grid</a>:</b> Whenever damage is applied to this ship, damage up to the
strength of the grid may be transferred to any unit.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="TRACTORBEAMS">Tractor Beams</a>:</b> Activated against a ship as a reaction, tractoring the
ship for 1 turn or until tractored by another tractor beam. The tractored ship
may only fire at this unit. Current fire from the unit is intercepted.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="COMMANDENCRYPTION">Command Encryption</a>:</b> Prevents miscommunications and command disjunction
from being played against the fleet by a player without a cryptologist in their
fleet.</p>
<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="ELECTRONICWARFARESYSTEM">ELECTRONIC WARFARE SYSTEM</a>:</b>  Each
Electronic Warfare Systems on a ship costs 
one energy point to activate. When an electronic warfare card ('electronic 
warfare' in the title) is played to a ship with an activated Electronic Warfare System, it is not discarded after use. During the Record Keeping Step of the 
next turn, the electronic warfare card is placed back into the hand. The first 
electronic warfare card (and second for ships with 2 Electronic Warfare Systems) 
played always consumes an Electronic Warfare System and cannot be discarded 
after use.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are only three cards that may be used with an
Electronic Warfare System: <a class="SubHead">R/O3 Defensive Electronic Warfare</a> (<a href="#UE-U">UE</a>/<a href="#PE-II">PE</a>),
<a class="SubHead">R/O3 Offensive Electronic Warfare</a> (<a href="#UE-U">UE</a>/<a href="#PE-II">PE</a>),

</p>
<p>
<b><a class="SubHead" name="EMF">ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD (EMF)</a>:</b>  <a href="#MECHADHOLDFAST">Mechad</a> ships use an
Electromagnetic Field (EMF) defense instead of
Shields. The EMF has a strength equal to the number of <a href="#NODE">Nodes</a> 
(&#10022;) multiplied by the 
number of energy points allocated to the EMF. Note that most Mechad ships have 
only one node and so the field strength will usually be equal to the number of 
energy points applied to the node. The maximum strength of the EMF is twice the 
strength of the ship; any energy applied in excess of this amount is wasted. The 
EMF strength represents the number of defensive points the Mechad ship has for 
that turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Mechad ship that is not engaged during the Engagement Phase, or a ship 
which is played from the hand is given a free EMF strength equal to the strength 
of the ship. If a Mechad ship is disengaged by any means other than during the 
owning player's Engagement Phase, the EMF strength does not change. (EXAMPLE: An 
M3 Alien Parasite card is played against an engaged S5 Mechad Heavy Cruiser with 
a current EMF strength of 10. Although the ship is immediately disengaged by the 
parasites, the EMF strength remains 10.) The EMF may not be repaired; it must be 
re-energized from scratch during each Allocation Phase.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Shield refits may not be applied to Mechad ships.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The EMF will not 
block the function of transporters.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The EMF is not treated as Shields for 
the purposes of cards that affect Shields.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When tracking EMF strength, it is best to "count down" by using a die to 
indicate the current strength of the EMF rather than the damage that it has 
sustained.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The EMF may only be increased in strength by an amount equal to the 
strength of the ship. EXAMPLE: A strength 7 ship has an EMF at strength 7, it 
sustains 4 damage, during the next Allocation Phase it can be re-powered to a 
maximum strength of 10 (not 14, the ship's ultimate maximum).
</p>

<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="IONNOVACANNONS">ION &amp; NOVA CANNONS</a>:</b> <a href="#ERODI">Erodi</a>
 ships can manipulate Ion storms and Nova explosions. 1 Ion or Nova hazard card
('ion' or 'nova' in the title) may
be played to an Ion or Nova cannon (respectively). The Ion or Nova may be
activated each turn. The hazard is discarded after use IF the energy allocated
to the system does not equal or exceed the strength of the hazard.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three cards which may be used with an Ion Cannon and three with a Nova Cannon: <a class="SubHead">H1 Ion Storm</a> (<a href="#AF-XI">AF</a>), 
<a class="SubHead">H2 Ion Storm</a> (<a href="#UE-U">UE</a>/<a href="#PE-II">PE</a>/<a href="#B-I">B</a>/<a href="#A-I">A</a>),

</p>

<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="MANEUVERINGSYSTEM">MANEUVERING SYSTEM</a>:</b> Each Maneuvering System
on a ship costs one energy point 
to activate. When a maneuver card ('maneuver' in the title) is played to a ship 
with an activated maneuver system, it is not discarded after use. During the 
Record Keeping Step of the next turn, the maneuver card is placed back into the 
hand. The first maneuver card (and second for ships with 2 Maneuvering Systems) 
played always consumes an activated Maneuvering System and cannot be discarded 
after use.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are seven cards that may be used with a
Maneuvering System: <a class="SubHead">R/L6 Lucky Maneuver</a> (<a href="#UE-U">UE</a>/<a href="#PE-II">PE</a>),
<a class="SubHead">O3 Tight Maneuver</a> (<a href="#GI-X">GI</a>), <a class="SubHead">R/O4 Formation Maneuver</a> (<a href="#Pir-VII">Pir</a>),

<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="MANEUVERINGTHRUSTERS">MANEUVERING THRUSTERS</a>:</b> 
 <a href="#TROCHILIDAE">
Trochilidae</a> ships are extremely agile; they avoid taking damage through the use of their
Maneuvering Thrusters. Maneuvering Thrusters reduce card damage and
opponent volleys (against the unit) by an amount equal to the energy applied if
1 (or more) card(s) causing the damage is of greater strength than the unit.
</p>

<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="MINEDEPLOYMENTSYSTEM">MINE DEPLOYMENT SYSTEM</a>:</b>  The <a href="#TUFORPROTECTORATE">Tufor</a> are masters of mine warfare and most of 
their ships use a device known as the Mine Deployment System (MDS). Each MDS 
requires one mine card and one supply point to function. An MDS permits one mine 
card to be used each turn but the mine card is not discarded after use, it 
remains on Tufor ship indefinitely. An MDS can have a supply point allocated to 
it prior to having a mine card played to the ship. Any mine cards played to that 
ship (over the number of activated MDSs) and activated are discarded after use.</p>

<p><a class="SubHead"><b>PHASER MAGNIFIER:</b></a> This is technically a non-heavy weapon. See the entry <a href="#PHASERMAGNIFIER">below</a>.</p>

<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="TRANSGATE">TRANSGATE</a>:</b> 
A <a href="#J'XAR">J'xar</a> ship may use each Transgate only once each complete turn as a card 
action or in reaction mode. A Transgate may be used in one of two modes:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A Transgate allows a J'xar unit to bring a J'xar ship into play fully 
engaged. The ship being 'gated in' must be a J'xar ship whose strength does not 
exceed the energy allocated to the Transgate. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A Transgate
allows a J'xar
unit to be recalled from play (returning the ship stack to the hand). The ship 
being 'recalled' must be a J'xar ship whose strength does not exceed the energy 
allocated to the Transgate.

<p><b><a class="SubHead" name="CLYDONEMPIRE">CLYDON EMPIRE</a>:</b>  (found in <a href="#NE-III">New
Empires</a> TM and later sets) Clydon Citizens are of several distinct subspecies, known as 
broods. Each brood serves a distinct function in Clydon society. For instance, 
Blood Clydon are the common warrior caste. Several broods are of very low caste 
and do not have Citizen status; some are only marginally intelligent. The Clydon 
Empire is the most aggressive major empire on the Far Side. Their ships use <a href="#StandardHeavyWeapons">Neutronium
Torpedoes</a>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clydon cruisers carry warcraft. A Clydon warcraft functions as follows:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Only certain Clydon ships can carry warcraft. Each card indicates if it may 
do so. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Playing a warcraft to a ship always requires a card play, a 
warcraft and ship may not be played as a single card play. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Most Clydon 
warcraft are designated as cards that may be played in reaction mode. However, 
they may only be played in reaction mode if: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a- they are played 
independently (i.e. not played onto a cruiser) and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b- they are played during 
another player's Weapons Fire Phase in order to block weapons fire that 
otherwise would have damaged the Sector HQ. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Clydon warcraft in play can 
separate from or attach to a ship. When this is done (only in a Card Play Phase) 
it consumes as a Card Play.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <a href="#PARALOID">Paraloid</a> and Clydon cruisers capable of carrying warcraft
may carry either Paraloid or Clydon warcraft. 
</p>
<p>NOTE: The Universe Edition rulebook does not state that Clydon ships and
warcraft combine. However, the New Empires rulebook originally said the
following:
<br><i>The Clydon use warcraft, which are similar in most respects to Krebiz
capsules. A Clydon warcraft functions as does a Krebiz capsule (see <a href="#Krebiz">Krebiz</a>
above) with the following exceptions:
<br></i>The exceptions listed were the rules for Clydon above. If treated like
Krebiz capsules this would mean that warcraft do, in fact, combine with the ship
they are carried by. In addition, three cards from the later expansions (Persona
and Galactic Invaders) specifically describe warcraft as &quot;combining&quot;
with the ship or base they are attached to. It seems this was an accidental
omission from the Universe Edition rulebook.
<br>This also implies that a ship may be played to an already in-play warcraft, and
a warcraft may be played to an already in-play ship, just like Krebiz ships and
capsules.

(found in <a href="#A-I">Alpha</a> and later sets) The Krebiz appear similar to man-size hermit 
crabs. Krebiz ships consist of two pieces: The cruiser (aft hull) and the 
capsule (forward hull). Krebiz Ships fire <a href="#StandardHeavyWeapons">Sabot</a>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Krebiz ship cards come in three types: Cruisers, capsules and combinations. 
A combination card counts as 1 card for <a href="#DeckConstruction">deck stocking rules (#1-3)</a>, 
but counts as 1 cruiser and 1 capsule (of that specific type) for purposes of duplicate card rules.
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i> <i>Beginner's Note: Universe Edition contains only combination ship cards for 
the Krebiz and these ships need not be separated, etc. Simply use them as 
complete ships and skip the Krebiz rules section.</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a capsule or cruiser is played by itself then it counts as 1 ship all by 
itself. A Krebiz cruiser with a capsule played on it counts as one ship of a 
strength equal to the sum of both cards. Only 1 cruiser and 1 capsule can 
combine at one time. A combination card has information for both the cruiser and 
capsule on it. It may be played as a cruiser, as a capsule or as the combination 
itself, it may even be played with other capsules or cruisers representing the 
opposite component. If played from the hand as one component, the other 
component is considered lost and unavailable for use.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A player may play a 
cruiser and a capsule at the same time as a single ship. This counts as the play 
of only one card for purposes of the three cards per turn limit, even though this 
one ship may actually consists of two cards.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A capsule may be played onto 
a previously played cruiser. A cruiser may be played onto a previously played 
capsule. When this happens, the two cards are immediately combined to form a 
single ship. Once combined, the two components can only be separated on the 
owning player's turn. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Separating the two components requires one Card Play 
to complete even though no card is actually played. Any accompanying cards, 
friendly or enemy, can be placed on the cruiser or capsule in any combination at 
the Krebiz player's option. Damage may be placed on the cruiser or capsule in 
any combination at the Krebiz player's option, however Shield damage must remain
Shield damage and structural damage must remain structural damage. Furthermore, 
damage may not be divided so as to destroy either the cruiser or the capsule. 
The two cards cannot be separated if there are not sufficient command slots. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Two components may be combined by using a Card Play, but not on a turn 
when either component has been separated.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cruiser and capsule combination may receive a number of supply and/or 
energy points sufficient to engage only one component of the combination. During 
the first Card Play Phase of that turn, the components must be separated as 
defined above and the one component that received enough supply and/or energy 
may be immediately engaged at that time, outside the Engagement Phase.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proxy card elements can be used as temporary substitutes for separated 
components of combination cards (EXAMPLE: Use a capsule or cruiser card from 
Primary Edition to represent separated components).
<br><a class="SubHead"><b>Optional Rule:</b></a>  With the introduction of the Combination Krebiz ships in
Universe Edition there's no reason why players can't treat the Primary Edition
ships as combination ships. Take both cards that are part of the intended
combination ship and put one in your deck while setting the other one aside next
to your Reserve Fleet. Mark the card that you are placing in the deck somehow;
for instance using a sharpie write the name of the card that is the other half
of the combination on the face of the card you're putting in your deck, or on
the card protector; or put a small slip of paper in the deck protector with the
name of the other half into the card protector. When the card is played take the
other half and place both in play as a single ship. Thereafter they will be
treated as two separate cards; one can be discarded while the other remains in
play, or if both are destroyed then both are put into the discard pile as
separate ships. If a later card play allows you to retrieve them from the
discard pile each card must be retrieved separately.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all intents and purposes treat both cards as if they were
in the deck, and in addition treat the combination as if it were it's own card
in the deck.
<br>EXAMPLE: Take an S3 Krebiz Dreadnought Capsule and a
S7 Krebiz King Kraken. On the front of the Dreadnought Capsule you write
&quot;S7 King Kraken.&quot; You place the S3 into your deck and set the S7
aside. This will count as a single S10 ship in your deck, and you may not have
another exactly identical combination. You could, however, create a second S10
using the S3 Krebiz Dreadnought Carrier and the S7 King Kraken. This would use
up two of your Entity slots in the deck, and count as two out of the three
copies of the S7 King Kraken allowed in the deck as well as counting as an
S3 Dreadnought Capsule and S3 Dreadnought Carrier.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you draw and play the S3 you will take the S7 and place
both units in play as a single combination unit. Thereafter they are treated as
the two separate cards until the end of the game.

not have a large or powerful star fleet and in most ways would qualify as a 
minor empire. However, their ships are never made available for hire by other

within the same fleet) must be destroyed before an Indirigan ship may fire on 
bases or non-Indirigan ships. Indirigan ships must obey any rules printed on the

through the Krebiz Capitalist Alliance and exited this galaxy bound for the
galaxy of Andromeda. It totally ravaged a Krebiz Capitalist Alliance core world
before leaving the Milky Way. Half of this tribe has returned. Having
encountered the Gekonauak on their intergalactic journey, they returned to warn

 (all <a href="#PE-II">Primary</a> and <a href="#UE-U">Universe Edition</a>

Grand Chieftain Marchias was the leader of the terrestrial Indirigans and led
the first pre-tribe into space. His tribe simply toured the galaxy, collecting
taxes from the other tribes whenever they were encountered.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="INFECTED">INFECTED</a>:</b> (<a href="#Promo">Promo</a> release) The infected were not always the hunted
outcasts that they are today. Many years ago they were known as the Healers.
Welcomed by nearly all space faring species with open arms, the Healers traded
their vast medical knowledge for much needed supplies and resources. Unlike many
Indirigan tribes, the Healers traveled the Far Side of the Galaxy seeking to
cure the sick, not to raid the weak!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since their infection they have self-imposed a quarantine on
their ships. Sadly, this has not stopped them from being hunted by almost every
empire in the Far Side because of the fear of contamination. Even the Mechad
seeks to destroy them, leading many to conjecture that the plague may be an
advanced form of nanotech virus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - All Infected Tribe ships are also <a href="#InfectedClassRules">Infected
class</a> and follow those rules.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="INVINCIBLELONER">INVINCIBLE LONER</a>:</b> (found in <a href="#AT-VI">Advanced

only one ship, the SSCS <i>'Invincible Indirigan'</i>. Noaha, the captain, often
engaged in unnecessary combat just for the challenge of doing so.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="LONEWOLF">LONE WOLF</a>:</b> (found in <a href="#GI-X">Galactic
Invaders</a> TM) Wolf was the Chief of Indirigan
Security Forces when the 'calling' came. He was unable to leave his law
enforcement beliefs behind to assume nomadic (and often criminal) ways. He
therefore took to defending various worlds from marauding Indirigan
Tribes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Indirigan ships in the fleet are not required to destroy
Lone Wolf ships.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Lone Wolf ships are not required to destroy other tribes in
the fleet.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="NAGIRIDNIPIRATETRIBE">NAGIRIDNI PIRATE TRIBE</a>:</b> (found in <a href="#NE-III">New

one of the few to actively take up piracy. Through dealings with the Corporate
Pirates, <a href="#SPECIALIZEDWEAPONMOUNT">Specialized Weapon Mounts</a> were installed on Nagiridni ships. The
Nagiridni tribe established a stationary home port on Nagir XII in the Free
Trade Zone near Argonian territory.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="PROPAGATIONISTS">PROPAGATIONISTS</a>:</b> (<a href="#Promo">Promo</a>
release) The Propagationists sought
to spread Indirigan settlers throughout the galaxy. A fair portion of Indirigan
people did not want to leave their terrestrial lives, but were forced to. Later,
many chiefs realized that this was not a good decision. The chief of the
Propagationists decided to make goon this initial error by dropping off these
settlers on various planets throughout the galaxy. After 40 percent of his tribe
elected to go terrestrial, he instituted a law that each male must produce at
least five children with each of his wives before being allowed to settle.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="PSYCHOTICS">PSYCHOTICS</a>:</b> (never printed) This tribe is made
up of of individuals brought to a Space Asylum by the other tribes; the most incurable
of the clinically insane. A tribe of mental health health experts known as
the Psychiatrists governed the Space Asylum. They were on the verge of
creating a device to cure insanity when the inmates rebelled and took charge of
their vessels. The inmates corrupted this device and managed to turn it into a
weapon which caused temporary insanity, called the Gray Matter Disruptor (GMD).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - When the GMD is activated (through the application of
Research points) it causes all crew at the target location to go temporarily insane,
disengaging them for 1 complete turn.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="SCIENTISTS">SCIENTISTS</a>:</b> (never printed) The Scientists consisted of a fleet
of science ships on a survey mission when 'the calling' came. This tribe now
wanders the Galaxy in search of interesting points of study. They generally do
not attack (except for social combat) but sell any interesting findings to the local
powers that be in exchange for supplies.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="VACATERSOFBOLAARV">VACATERS OF BOLAAR V</a>:</b> (found in <a href="#AT-VI">Advanced
Technology</a> TM) The Vacaters
consisted primarily of the Indirigans who were occupying Bolaar V when the
'calling' came to abandon terrestrial life within Indirigan Space. This tribe
conducted trade in Indirigan Space for some time before it went through a
wormhole in the Homecloud Nebula in Y158, causing all kinds of trouble on the
near side (Earth side) of the galaxy.
<br><b><a class="SubHead" name="VICIOUSSIX">VICIOUS SIX</a>:</b> (found in <a href="#Pir-VII">Piracy</a>
TM) One of the most aggressive
Indirigan Tribes, the Vicious Six would ruthlessly ravage any planet in their
path. After departing Indirigan Space this tribe chose a spiraling path,
starting in Clydon territory, to strike every major race on the Far Side before
entering unexplored space near the Mechad Holdfast.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Vicious Six ships may move against terrain via <a href="#ShipMovementRules">ship

(found in <a href="#AF-XI">Allied Forces</a> TM)
 Developing along parallel lines to the Tufor, the Erodi
 originated from within the Tuforeous Dead Zone. Having just recently
left the Tuforeous Dead Zone, they allied with the Tufor in exchange for
starship technology. Their humanoid form may tie them genetically to the Tufor. If
their Sector HQ was destroyed, they had the fallback position in the Tuforeous
Dead Zone.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hazardous conditions of the Tuforeous Dead Zone forced
the Erodi to manipulate hazards for survival. While not actually cannons, Erodi
equipment manipulated local hazards to damage opponents. The
<a href="#IONNOVACANNONS">Nova Cannon</a> was used in fleet actions; the
explosive nature of the nova could defeat entire fleets. The <a href="#IONNOVACANNONS">Ion
Cannon</a> proved most effective in ship-to-ship conflicts. Their weapon of choice is the <a href="#StandardHeavyWeapons">Thunderbolt Devastator</a>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: Two <a href="#ERODI">Erodi</a> ships
apparently lost Phaser points they should have had due to printing errors. The <i>S4 Erodi&nbsp;Light
War Cruiser</i> probably should have had 2 Phasers; the <i>S7 Erodi Battleship</i>
probably should have had 3 Phasers.

(found in <a href="#AF-XI">Allied Forces</a> TM) The Pakta'don specialized in fleet
operations. They would often deploy militia squads from their smaller units to
draw fire away from key units in the fleet. They were well suited to aid other
empires due to their ability to handle a number of threats with their <a href="#PULSEPHASER">Pulse Phasers</a>, which allowed massive firepower to be contained within reasonable sized

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Paraloid and <a href="#CLYDONEMPIRE">Clydon</a> cruisers capable of carrying warcraft

(found in <a href="#AF-XI">Allied Forces</a> TM)
 The Shon-ti are a large, slow-moving insect race. However, their brood are
small and agile for the first few years of their lives.&nbsp; Shon-ti do not
gain their beliefs in assassination until after their brood stage. This
empowered elders to eliminate undesirable brood stock without risking assassination.
They avoid hand-to-hand combat at all cost, preferring to observe physical
violence from a distance, preferably with a heavy blast rifle in hand.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their alliance with the Zedan was due to their mutual belief
of promotion through assassination. However, Shon-ti would consume their
defeated Shon-ti prey out of respect. Both Zedan and Shon-ti engaged in an
annual contest of assassination where the contestants competed until only one
remained. They're rumored to be the only empire which know of the true nature of
the Zedan.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shon-ti always developed sector HQs on planetary
surfaces. Shon-ti ships use <a href="#SWARMBOLTS">Swarm Bolts</a> to engage
multiple targets at a single location.

worshipped the
Argonians as gods. They now serve the Argonian First Republic out of respect.
Tarra'ki are amorphous beings made of a substance similar to mud, clay and rock,
with lava like blood.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Tarra'ki, antimatter technology was child's play,
allowing them to use their devastating weapon on mass-produced hull designs.
They designed their <a href="#AUXILIARYSHIELDS">Auxiliary
Shields</a> to allow more effective use of the <a href="#POSITRONEMITTER">Positron Emitters</a>.
They began designing starships to defend the borders of Argonian space
when the homecloud began to collapse; the depletion of the Argonian nebula
caused the Tarra'ki to ally with their neighbors.

dark matter nebula as the Leopan Conquistadors. The avian nature of Trochilidae
has ties with some of the known time knight beings. Their alliance with the
Leopan is one of the most tentative on the Far Side.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bird-like agility of the Trochilidae is apparent in their
maneuverable ship designs thanks to their <a href="#MANEUVERINGTHRUSTERS">Maneuvering

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cyberspace is an artificial parallel dimension created by the cybermages 
inside the Galacticnet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Cards in cyberspace do not affect the active 
fleet and cards in the active fleet do not affect cyber space. Cards in 
cyberspace cannot protect, damage or affect the Sector HQ or Psy Network. Cards 
that exist in both the active fleet and cyberspace may affect and may be 
affected by both. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <a href="#CyberClassRules">Cyber cards</a> (or
cards that state they may by played to 
cyberspace) may be played to or against cyberspace or the active fleet. Only 
cyber cards may be played to or against cyberspace (non-cyber cards may not be 
played to or against cards in cyberspace). 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Any cards in play on a card in 
cyberspace also exist in cyberspace (EXAMPLE: An A5 Greater Automaton on a C4 
Cybermage). 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Energy from the active fleet may be allocated into cyberspace. 
The maximum amount of energy that may be allocated in cyberspace is equal to the 
sum strength of all engaged cybermages in the active fleet. 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pseudo-locations in cyberspace:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - All locations in the active fleet have a pseudo-location in cyberspace. A 
pseudo-location is not a real location, but merely a link from real space to 
cyberspace. A pseudo-location is not capable of supporting cards that require a 
location, it is merely a point where a cybership can link to the active fleet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Cyber cards in the active fleet always exist at both the fleet location 
and the pseudo-location in cyberspace. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Only cyberships may be played or 
moved to a pseudo-location. Cyber crew, equipment, etc. must be played to a 
location (not a pseudo-location) in cyberspace, such as a cybership. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- 
Cyberships (ships existing only in cyberspace) may be moved during the 
Allocation Phase from one pseudo-location to another. Players may only have 
cyberships in play at pseudo-locations in their own fleet. A player may only 
have one cybership at a given pseudo-location. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - When a cybership is moved 
to a pseudo-location, cyber cards on the location in the active fleet are 
considered to be in play on the cybership also. Additionally, any cards on the 
cybership may be considered to be in play on the location in the fleet. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- If 
either of a cyber card's two locations (cybership or location in the fleet) is 
destroyed the cyber card is considered to be in play on only the remaining 
location. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If a cybership moves while a cyber card on the cybership 
coexists at a location in the active fleet, the cyber card may only remain at 
one of the two locations (either the cybership or the location in the fleet).

TM)
<br><a href="#ToC">Return to the Table of Contents</a></h3>

<p><a class="SubHead"><b>PSY NETWORK:</b></a> The Psy Network is functionally similar to the Sector HQ in most respects but 
note the following:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 25 points of damage to the Psy Network knocks that player out of the game. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Only '<a class="SubHead" href="#PSY">P</a>' psy cards protect the Psy Network; ships, bases, dragons etc. do 
not. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Cards that protect the Psy Network do not protect
the Sector HQ and cards that protect the Sector HQ do not protect the Psy
Network
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- <a href="#VISONIC">
Visonic</a> and <a href="#PSYCANTI">Psycanti</a> psys can protect their respective Psy Networks only. 
</p>

<p><a class="SubHead"><b>TARGETING PSY CARDS:</b></a> Weapons fire can damage psy cards and the Psy Network:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Shields of a ship, base, terrain or other location protect the psy cards at 
that location as though the Shields were on the psy.
<br><a class="SubHead"><b>Optional Rule:</b></a> Psy cards protect the structure of their location from
weapons fire, though Shields still protect the Psy card. EXAMPLE: If a
Psy is played on a Base first the Shields of the base must be damaged, then the
Psy, then finally the structure of the Base itself. This can be done in a single volley by targeting the
Base directly, as the Psy automatically intercepts the damage to the base. However, if any
damage is done to the Psy it counts as a volley aimed at that Psy, so it
cannot be targeted again that turn. 
</p>
<p><a class="SubHead"><b>DISCIPLINES:</b></a> Most psys are capable of using one or more psy disciplines. Field cards are 
categorized by one or more of the following discipline groups:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psycanti Discipline: The discipline used primarily by the
Psycanti.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visonic Discipline: The discipline used primarily by the
Visonics.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elder Discipline: The discipline used primarily by the Elders.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cyber 
Discipline: A technical discipline merging technology with mind powers. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kinetic Discipline: A discipline revolving around heat and other forms of 
energy. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fleet Discipline: Any and all field cards in play in the fleet. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any Discipline: Any and all field cards in play in all of the
player's 
fleets. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-Fleet Discipline: Any and all field cards in play outside the 
player's fleet. 
</p>

<p><a class="SubHead"><b>PSY FUNCTIONS:</b></a> A psy card can use functions from engaged field cards as indicated on the psy 
card.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - This will usually cost a number of resource points allocated in a manner 
similar to the way ammunition points are allocated. The psy can only use 
functions from field cards that are categorized as being in the discipline at 
the bottom of the psy card. (EXAMPLE: If a psy card has (&#10040;&#10040;&#10040;: Cyber Discipline), 
that card can use up to 3 functions (at a cost of 1 energy each) from field 
cards categorized as being in the cyber discipline).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Psys may only use 
functions from engaged fields in play in their own fleet unless noted by a card 
rule. 
</p>

<p><a class="SubHead"><b>FIELD CARD OPERATION:</b></a> A number of psy functions is listed at the bottom of a field card. Each 
function has a number before it. This number indicates the minimum strength that 
a psy must be in order to use that function.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - For psys to use functions from the field card, the field card must be 
engaged. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Reaction-mode field cards are played engaged when played in 
reaction mode and allows one psy capable of using the field to use one of its 
functions as a reaction at no cost. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Each function of each field in play 
may only be used once per complete turn. A color bead should be placed on the 
function and on the psy that activated that function. This will help players 
keep track of functions that last through a complete turn. This applies even 
when an opponent has used one of your psy functions (you can't use it since it's 
in use until the Record Keeping Step of the opponent's next turn). 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- A function deactivates in the next Record Keeping Step of the player who activated 
it. They are activated (or possibly reactivated) during either Card Play Phase. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If a psy is discarded functions it activated cease immediately, but these 
functions may not be used again until the end of the complete turn. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Any 
functions that have a stated duration of more than one turn may not be reused 
until their duration expires.

<br><a class="SubHead"><b>Optional Rule:</b></a> Psy decks can be a little weak, and become very dependent on Terrain. When a 
Field card is played to a Terrain it combines with the Terrain, adding its strength to that off the 
Terrain. This makes Terrain more resilient 
while not making them indestructible. This rule should only be used if promotional Terrain with
shields aren't being used, as those Terrain are already more resillient.

SHIP MOVEMENT RULES</a> (found in <a href="#Pir-VII">Piracy</a> TM)<a href="#ToC"><br>Return to the Table of Contents</a></h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Ships in the fleet may be moved once each <a href="#2-EngagementPhase">Allocation
Phase</a>. They may move 
to a terrain card or be moved into space (independently).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some cards allow one player's ship to be moved into position against another 
player's terrain. A ship in play against an opponent's fleet does not protect 
its Sector HQ.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A ship in play on a terrain (defending) prevents an opponent ship of equal 
or lesser strength from being moved into position against that terrain 
(attacking). A ship in play against a terrain (attacking) prevents an opponent 
ship of lesser strength from being moved into position on that terrain 
(defending).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - When a ship is moved to a terrain with a ship of equal or lower strength 
played against it, the ship played against the terrain is moved off of the 
terrain. The ship moved off the terrain does not protect its Sector HQ until it 
is moved back to a location where it can do so.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - When a ship is moved against a terrain with a ship of lower strength played 
to it, the ship played to the terrain is moved off of the terrain. The ship 
moved off the terrain still protects its Sector HQ.

<p><a class="SubHead"><b>TIME ORIGIN:</b></a> The time origin is a shared location at the center of the table. The time 
origin is not a card or stack of cards, and cannot have cards played on it or 
against it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Time knights, Tranoan ships and some other cards have two strengths. The 
first value is their strength when they are in the fleet (normal strength), the 
second value is their strength when they are at the time origin (time strength). 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - All cards with a split strength are stocked in the deck using the first 
value (their fleet strength). 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - No card may be played to the time origin 
from the hand unless that card says it can do so. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Cards at the time origin 
can only affect cards at the time origin, and cards outside the time origin can 
only affect cards outside the time origin. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Cards at the time origin do 
occupy command slots just as they would if they were in the fleet. Cards at the 
time origin never protect the Sector HQ or Psy Network. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Cards at the time 
origin are considered in play and can be allocated to, engaged, and take their 
actions (within the time origin only, of course). 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Cards with a time 
strength (time knights, temporal snakes, Tranoan ships etc.) can only be 
completely destroyed (discarded) when at the time origin. If in the fleet at the 
time an action would normally force them to be discarded, they are moved to the 
time origin instead. When a card is moved to the time origin (along with any 
other cards in play on that card) all damage applied to it and all opponent 
cards played against it while outside the time origin are removed and discarded. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Cards at the time origin may only move back into the fleet by use of 
special cards. When a card moves to the fleet from the time origin, all damage 
applied to it and opponent cards played against it while inside the time origin 
are removed and discarded. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The time origin can be (temporarily) destroyed 
by 25 points of damage applied by anything that can score damage on a Sector HQ 
or Psy Network. These points must be scored from outside the time origin. These 
points are cumulative. Any player may score points against the time origin. No 
card can protect the time origin. All cards of all players at the time origin 
when it is destroyed are discarded. When the time origin is destroyed in this 
way, it immediately reforms (empty, of course, until cards are moved into it).

<h3 align="center"><a class="SubHead" name="NarrativeExample">NARRATIVE EXAMPLE</a>
<br><a href="#ToC">Return to the Table of Contents</a></h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We strongly recommend that novice game players place cards on the table while 
following the narrative below. Mimicking Bob and Sue's actions will give you the 
feel for game mechanics more quickly. If you do not have a card that is 
mentioned below, substitute another card of the same type and strength as 
necessary. See also the Card Play diagram in the centerfold of this booklet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob and Sue are playing a standard game. Each has a deck of cards and has 
shuffled, cut and drawn an ante. Sue's ante is higher in strength and she goes 
first.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sue plays a T3 Asteroid Belt. She has no other terrain cards to play. She has 
8 cards in her hand so she draws two cards from her deck.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob plays a T4 Small Planet. He also has no other terrain in his hand. He has 
8 cards left in his hand and so he draws two cards, ending the first complete 
turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sue plays a T1 Small Moon. Then she plays a disengaged S1 Fleet Freighter on 
her T3 Asteroid Belt. She draws two cards, ending her turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob plays a disengaged B4 Base Station on his T4 Small Planet and an M1 Small 
Phaser Eel on Sue's S1 freighter. Sue plays an R/C4 Science Officer onto her 
freighter in reaction to Bob's Phaser eel. Bob's turn ends and he draws two 
cards.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sue now allocates her terrain points. The freighter requires one supply and 
one energy point. Her two terrain cards provide this easily and she engages the 
freighter by turning the freighter upright. Sue then plays an E2 Phaser Refit 
and an E1 Shield Refit on her freighter. Bob's Sector HQ is vulnerable because 
he has no ships in play; his base cannot defend his Sector HQ. She declares 
weapons fire on Bob's Sector HQ. The freighter has 2 Phasers plus 1 from the 
refit, for a total of 3. The Phaser eel does not block these because the 
science officer suspends the hostile effects of monsters. Bob places a die in 
front of himself with the 3 showing to represent the damage to his Sector HQ. 
Sue now plays her last card, an H2 Ion Storm on Bob's base. He places a die at 
the upper right side of the card, near the Shield symbols, with a 2 showing to 
represent the damage to the base's Shields. Sue draws two cards.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First Bob repairs his one free Shield point changing the 2 to a 1. Bob then 
allocates his terrain points. His base needs one energy point to be engaged and 
his T4 planet provides one energy point. The planet also provides one economy 
point that Bob declares as a repair point, removing the die from his base. His 
planet also produces 2 supply points, but Bob has no use for these points so 
they are lost. Bob now plays a disengaged S4 Indirigan Frigate. He declares 
weapons fire on Sue's freighter causing 2 points of Phaser damage from his B4 
Base Station. Bob then plays an E2 Nuclear Mine on his base and uses it against 
Sue's freighter causing 2 more damage points. Sue places a die near the 
freighter's Shield points with a 4 showing. Bob discards the mine card and then 
ends his turn by drawing 2 cards.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sue changes the 4 to a 3 for her one point of automatic Shield
repair that 
turn. She has two economy points left over after maintaining her freighter's 
engaged status. She allocates these as repair on her freighter's Shields turning 
the die to a 1. Sue plays a disengaged S5 Light Cruiser. She also plays an M3 
Shield Fiend on Bob's S4 Indirigan Frigate. The Shield fiend damages all of the 
frigate's Shields and is then discarded. Sue then plays an M4 Space Dragon to 
the frigate, causing two more points of damage. Sue then declares weapons fire 
from her freighter for 2 more damage points and the frigate is destroyed. The 
frigate and the space dragon are discarded. Sue then declares her last point of 
weapons fire on Bob's Sector HQ, bringing him to 4 points total.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Play continues in this manner.

The Standard Game rules are used, but each player stocks his deck with
200 strength points of cards (or 250, or 400... whatever is agreed upon ahead of
time). This may mean the player will have to a select few strong cards or many
weak cards. There are no restrictions as to strengths or quantities of cards
chosen, but at least 8 different card types must be represented with at least 1
card each. This is often a better way for beginning players to stock their deck.
</p><p align="left"><b><a class="SubHead" name="TheGamblers">The Gamblers</a>:</b> Players play for keeps. Every five points of damage a player causes to
another player's Sector HQ allows him to draw one card from that player's deck,
keep it and place it in his hand. At this point the damaged player also draws
one card from his own deck and places it in his own hand. Any rules can be used.
Players are not eliminated by 25 points of Sector HQ damage, but may play until
they just don't want to lose any more cards. Quitting is only allowed on your
own turn before any actions are taken.
</p><p align="left"><b><a class="SubHead" name="EveryonePlaysToTheEnd">Everyone Plays To The End</a>:</b>
In this variation, the winner is the first player to score a total of 50
points of damage to opponent Sector HQs. This damage may be scored on one or
several Sector HQs. A player is not eliminated from play by the 25th damage
point on his Sector HQ; all players continue to play until one player
accumulates the 50 points needed to win. However, a player who scores the 25th
damage point (and each multiple of the 25th damage point) on a player's Sector
HQ gets a two card victory celebration as per the standard rules.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This variation is best when playing with friends, since no one has to sit around
and watch TV while everyone else continues to have fun with Galactic Empires
just because of a knockout early in the game.
</p><p align="left"><b><a class="SubHead" name="FreeForAll">Free For All</a>:</b> Each player may use as many cards of any type or strength to play and
the players are not required to stock their deck with only one empire' ships.
Ships from more than one empire may be in play at the same time. All Standard
Game rules apply.
</p><p align="left"><b><a class="SubHead" name="TheEgoGame">The Ego Game</a>:</b> Players may pick and chose any rules or variations they with or even
make up their own. The player with the biggest ego and biggest mouth (tape
measure optional) will control which rules will be used.
<br></p><h3 align="center"><a class="SubHead" name="AFewMoreVariations">A Few More Variations</a>
</h3>

<p><i>Disengaged Ships are Out of Play:</i> If a ship is disengaged, it
does not protect the Sector HQ. Games will end much faster this way.
</p>

<p><i>Stack Your Deck:</i> Instead of shuffling your deck before play, put
the cards in the order in which you wish them to be drawn. Do not cut the deck
before play, either. This will eliminate <b>ALL</b> luck from the game&ndash; even
the ante card can be selected since it will be the first card at the top of the
deck, placed there by the owning player when he determines the stacking of his
deck.
</p>

<p><i>Defenders Shoot Back:</i> Defending units shoot back at one attacking
unit when fired upon. The defending unit may fire back only if it is disengaged,
but it may fire all of its weapons. This defensive fire may not be made in
reaction to card plays.
</p>

<p><i>Bases Defend Ships:</i> Ships may be stacked with a base. The ship and
base may be fired at and have cards played on them normally. If an opponent
fires at the ship, the base will fire all its weapons (whether Engaged or not)
at one attacking unit. This defensive fire may not be made in reaction to card
plays, only weapons fire. If the base is attacked, neither it nor the ship gets
to fire. The ship is not destroyed if the base is destroyed.
</p>

<p><i>Restricted Bases:</i> Based cannot fire at terrain or other base
cards.
</p>

<p><i>One Target Only:</i> Each ship and base and other cards with weapons
may fire at only one target each turn; all of the unit's weapons damage is
applied to that one target. Several firing units may combine their fire onto a
single target into a single weapons volley as normal, or each firing unit may
fire at a different target.
</p>

<p><i>Border Defense:</i> Weapons fire may only be at players sitting
adjacent to each other. Card plays may be made on any player.

&nbsp;<b><a class="SubHead" name="AF-XI">Allied Forces - AF - Series XI</a> - December 1996</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 145 card expansion released in 100 card starters. Boosters may have been
planned but were never released. Contained
starters for the <a href="#DRONE">Drone</a>, <a href="#ERODI">Erodi</a>, <a href="#NOBLES">Nobles</a>,
<a href="#PAKTA'DON">Pakta'don</a>, <a href="#PARALOID">Paraloid</a>, <a href="#SHON-TI">Shon-ti</a>,
<a href="#TARRA'KI">Tarra'ki</a>, <a href="#TREGLEAN">Treglean</a>, <a href="#TROCHILIDAE">Trochilidae</a>,
<a href="#BOLAARPIRATES">Bolaar</a>, <a href="#CORPORATEPIRATES">Corporate
Pirate</a>, and <a href="#LEOPANCONQUISTADORS">Leopan</a>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: Allied Forces, being the last expansion actually
printed before Companion Games went out of business, was apparently rushed. As such it
had quite a few text errors; most of these were merely flavor text, however
among the more significant errors two <a href="#ERODI">Erodi</a> ships apparently lost Phaser
points they should have had. The <i>S4 Erodi&nbsp;Light War Cruiser</i>
probably should have had 2 Phasers; the <i>S7 Erodi Battleship</i> probably
should have had 3 Phasers.&nbsp;

&nbsp;<b><a class="SubHead" name="Promo">Promo Cards - Pro1 - Pro6
<br></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> There were at least 7 different runs of promotional cards done over the years,
over 300 promo cards (my count is 327, but I'm sure I'm missing a few from my
list). Some of the promos are much easier to
find than others. Included in these promo cards were quite a few new <a href="#INDIRIGANNOMADTRIBES">Indirigan
Nomad Tribes</a> as well as the <a href="#AESTHETICEMPIRE">Aesthetic</a> and <a href="#COLLECTOREMPIRE">Collector</a>
empires. The 7th set was dubbed the Indirigan Touring Game, containing several
unique Indirigan cards.
