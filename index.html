	<p class="text">So what is the Galactic Empires Card Museum? Well, I've
	scanned most of my Galactic Empires card collection into the computer, some
	2,100 cards. This
	took a rather lot of work, both to scan and then to organize the cards. It's a
	symptom of my insanity, and you get to benefit from it! Thanks largely to the
	efforts of Joe Collins and Craig Sentz I've now managed to post almost every GE
	card ever released - something on the order of 2,500 cards.</p>

	<p class="text">The community that used to exist around Galactic Empires
	has sort of broken up, but a couple of us are trying to rebuild that community.
	<a href="http://galacticempires.org/" target="_blank">GalacticEmpires.org</a> may
	be rebuilt and reborn at some point in the future, but for now we
	have a FaceBook group you can join us at:<br>
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/496750357169410" target="_blank">Galactic Empires
	CCG Players, Collectors, and Sales</a>. I've also recently added a plugin for VTT play to

<div id="WhatIs" style="clear: both;"></div>
	<h2>What is Galactic Empires?</h2>

	<p class="text"><b><i>Galactic Empires</i></b> was perhaps the second CCG ever released, right on the heels 
	of <b><i>Magic: The Gathering</i></b>. <b>Companion Games</b> released the original set in late 1994 and continued
	releasing new cards through the end of 1996. At that point Companion Games declared bankruptcy and the rights to 
	the game were acquired by one of the creditors who let the game die.</p>

	<p class="text"><i><b>Galactic Empires</b></i> is largely a <i>Ship</i>
	combat game, though there are a number of different kinds of cards which can
	can be played to affect the ships or the combat. <i>Terrain</i> provide
	resource points which you used to &quot;engage&quot; the <i>Ships</i>, <i>Bases</i>,
	and some other cards. <i>Bases</i> are played to <i>Terrain</i> cards to
	help protect them. <i>Crew</i> and <i>Equipment</i> can be played to <i>Ships</i>
	or <i>Bases</i> providing benefits. <i>Ability</i> cards can be played to <i>Crew</i>
	or various other cards to enhance their abilities. <i>Hazard</i> cards
	represent various space anomalies which can damage <i>Ships</i> and
	sometimes other types of cards, while <i>Monsters</i> represent space
	creatures which can attack <i>Ships</i>, <i>Crew</i>, or some other cards. <i>Luck</i>
	cards represent particularly lucky or unlucky things happening, while <i>Occurrence</i>
	cards represent significant events which affect the game.</p>

	<p class="text">Each player builds a play deck themed around one of
	many released empires. They can add ships of some minor empires to support
	their deck as well as cards of the various other types to flesh out their
	deck. Decks must have at least 40 cards, however the deck stocking rules are
	somewhat restrictive and to be able to stock the more powerful cards the
	deck will need to be much larger. Most tournament decks were 100-150 cards,
	meaning that the slimed down fast play deck of other games are less useful
	in this one.</p>

	<p class="text"><b>Series I</b> is the label collectively given to the first two sets released,
	often called <b>Alpha Edition</b> and <b>Beta Editions</b>. The original sets were based largely on empires,
	artwork, and lore that had originally been developed by <b><i>Companion Games</i></b> for use with the 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Fleet_Battles">Starfleet Battles</a> wargame.
	These sets were released as test sets; <b>Alpha</b> contained 91-cards while <b>Beta</b> made some changes
	to the artwork and rules on a few cards, and had only 90-cards. These sets contained cards from two major empires &ndash; the 
	<i>Argonian First Republic</i> and <i> Krebiz Capitalist Alliance</i>.
	It was released in 10-card booster packs and 50-card starter decks;
	the starters had a fixed selection ships from both empires. Each empire's ships had unique abilities
	as well as unique cards which could be played to their ships to improve them. It
	had a couple minor empire cards as well; the distinction being that major empire
	cards could only be used in decks built around that major empire while minor
	empire cards could be used in decks built around them or they could be used as
	support cards in decks of other empires.</p>

	<p class="text"><b>Primary Edition (Series II)</b> was the first true core set which followed shortly thereafter. 
	This 440-card set greatly expanded the number of cards and included cards for playing several new empires including 
	the <i>Argonian</i> and <i>Krebiz</i> from the first set plus two new major empires, the
	<i>Mechad Holdfast</i> and <i>Corporate Aggressors</i>, as well as adding several minor empires to the game &ndash; 
	the <i>Bolaar Pirates, Indirigan Nomads, Vektrean Mercenaries</i>, and <i>Space Dragons</i>.
	Cards came in various rarity levels; Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare, and
	Entity. Common and Uncommon seemed to have the same distribution in expansion
	packs, but Commons also appeared in starters (thus making them more common).
	It was released in 36-pack booster boxes, with each pack containing 12-cards. Two
	50-card starters were released, <b>Basic Deck A</b> came with <i>Argonian&nbsp;/&nbsp;Krebiz</i>
	like the <b>Series I</b> starters while <b>Basic Deck B</b> contained <i>Mechad&nbsp;/&nbsp;Corporate</i>
	ships. 45 of the cards in each starter were pre-selected, with 5 semi-random cards.</p>

	<p class="text"><b>New Empires (Series III)</b> was the first big
	expansion, containing 210-cards and adding four new major empires, the <i>Clydon Empire,
	Plasma Occupied Territory (P.O.T.), Scorpead Dominion</i>, and <i>Tufor Protectorate</i>
	as well as adding a minor empire, the <i>Nagiridni Pirates Indirigan Nomads Tribe</i>.
	A new starter called <b>Basic Deck C</b> was released which contained <i>P.O.T.&nbsp;/&nbsp;Scorpead</i>
	cards. Like the previous starters this 50-card deck had 45 pre-selected cards and
	5 semi-random.</p>

	<p class="text"><b>Powers of the Mind (Series IV)</b> had 152-cards
	and introduced three new major empires - two Psy based empires, the <i>Psycanti</i>
	and <i>Visonic</i>, and a parasitic race called the <i>Filarian Infesters</i> which could
	infest and take over opponent ships. This expansion was perhaps the weakest of all the
	expansions, with the new empires playing very differently than any of the
	other ship-based empires. There were also no starters for these empires ever
	released, meaning in order to track down enough cards to play these empires
	you had to buy booster boxes of cards. It also introduced a set of new rules for
	playing Psy's and using their abilities.</p>

	<p class="text"><b>Time Gates (Series V)</b> had 157-cards and was
	perhaps one of the strongest expansions due to the number of powerful
	&quot;time&quot; cards it contained. It introduced two new minor empires the
	<i>Time Knights</i> and time traveling <i>Tranoan Empire</i>. Cards from these empires worked
	quite well as support cards in other decks. It introduced a set of new rules
	for a new play area called the &quot;Time Origin&quot; where Time Knights,
	Tranoan ships, and a select few other cards would be moved to when destroyed in
	the main play area.</p>

	<p class="text"><b>Universe Edition (Series U)</b> was a major core
	set with 564-cards, designed to replace Primary Edition and New Empires.
	It largely drew on cards from <b>Series II &amp; III</b>,
	with a few cards from <b>Series IV &amp; V</b>. It had ten different
	100-card starters, each relatively playable and themed for a single empire.
	Each starter had a window in the back allowing you to see one of the empire
	specific cards in the deck, allowing you to differentiate which empire the
	deck was for. Going forward all starters would be labeled &quot;Universe
	Edition&quot; no matter which set they belonged to. Approximately 80 of the 
	cards were semi-random while 20 of the cards were
	fixed for the empire of the deck. There were decks for <i>Argonian</i>,
	<i>Clydon, Corporate, Krebiz, Mechad, P.O.T.</i>,
	<i>Scorpead, Space Dragons, Tufor</i>, and <i>Vektrean</i>.</p>

	<p class="text"><b>Advanced Technologies (Series VI)</b> 
	contained 152-cards which were mostly &quot;power&quot; cards and ships for the
	various empires as well as upgrades for their ships.&nbsp;It introduced
	the&nbsp;<i>Vacaters of Bolaar V Indirigan Tribe</i>.</p>


	<p class="text"><b>Piracy (Series VI)</b> was a 205-card expansion
	themed around pirates. It reprinted and added to the <i>Bolaar Pirates</i>
	and <i>Nagiridni Pirates</i> as well as adding a new major empire, the <i>Leopan
	Conquistadors</i> and two new minor empires, the <i>Corporate Pirates</i>
	and the <i>Vicious Six Indirigan Pirate Tribe</i>.</p>


	<p class="text"><b>Comedy Club on the Far Side of the Galaxy (Series
	VIII)</b> was a 177-card expansion released in four different 100 card
	starters. Each starter had a pre-selected set of cards many of which had up
	to four versions which only differed by having a different quote on them.
	Intended largely as a joke set, it introduced a new major empire based
	around ancients Installations called the <i>Comedy Club Network</i>.</p>


	<p class="text"><b>Persona (Series IX)</b> was a 205-card expansion
	themed around the Persona class of cards - cards that were unique and only
	one of which could be in play at a time. It introduced a crew based empire
	the <i>Nobles</i> and the <i>Lone Wolf Indirigan Tribe</i>, and had a decent
	mix of useful and powerful cards.</p>


	<p class="text"><b>Galactic Invaders (Series X)</b> was a 258-card
	expansion which introduced several new empires and had five new starter
	decks for the major empires the <i>Aqaaran, Gekonauak, J'xar</i>,
	and <i>Zedan</i> as well as the minor empire the <i>Orgon</i>. It also
	introduced the minor empire the <i>Treglean</i> and the <i>Andromeda Bound
	Indirigan Tribe</i>. This set is generally well regarded with the new
	empires being unique and fairly well balanced, if a little powerful.</p>


	<p class="text"><b>Allied Forces (Series XI)</b> was a 145-card
	expansion which was released in a set of twelve starter decks. A
	few of the decks were for previously released empires, including the <i>Bolaar
	Pirates, Corporate Pirates, Leopan, Nobles,</i> and <i>Treglean</i>. Decks for
	these empires contained both reprinted cards and new cards. The remaining
	seven starters introduced new Allied
	empires &ndash; minor empires which were allied with
	one of the major empires. While they could be used as minor empire cards in
	decks of any empire, they had some game mechanical benefits if used in a deck of their
	allied empire. These empires included the <i>Drone (Allied - Mechad), Erodi
	(Allied - Tufor), Pakta'don (Allied - P.O.T.), Paraloid (Allied - Clydon),
	Shon-ti (Allied - Zedan), Tarra'ki (Allied - Argonian)</i>, and the <i>Trochilidae
	(Allied - Leopan)</i>.</p>

	<p class="text"><b>Primary Tactics</b> was an <a href="#PrimaryTactics">audio drama</a> released
	on cassette and CD. It came packed with one of two promo cards, the C10 Battle Advisor or the
	E7 Megasonic Phase Distorter.

	<p class="text"><b>The Play Mat</b> was released near the end as well. It came with a promo card, 


	<p class="text">Beyond these sets there was a <b></b> and an
	audio tape and CD called <i>Primary Tactics</i>, each of which came with a
	promotional card. There were at least seven promotional card runs which were
	printed for the game, containing approximately 366 cards. A number of <i>Space
	Dragon, Bolaar Pirates,</i> and <i>Nagriridni Pirate</i> ships were released as promotional
	cards, as well as the <i>Aesthetics</i> minor empire. A number of 
	<i>Indirigan Tribes</i> were introduced as parts of these promotional sets,
	including the <i>Council of Six, Garshain, Gray Death, Infected, Insipid, Meerkats,
	Propagationist, Vinciennes Pirates, Violator's Pirates</i>. <b><i>Galactic Empires</i></b> had the distinction of having
	released the most Promotional cards of any CCG for at least a decade after the company went out of business, largely
	because the company had started allowing people and companies to special order Promotional Cards with their name or 
	business name, phone number, or other contact information on them. Many game stores and distributors ordered cards 
	and handed them out or sold them as a form of business card or premium card to players and collectors.</p>

<div id="Collecting" style="clear: both;"></div>
	<h2>Where to Start Collecting</h2>

	<p class="text">So you're interested in collecting the cards now, in late 2022 or later, but
	need to know where to begin. To start with, eBay is basically the only marketplace where you can
	get cards at this time. A number of sellers have singles, and once you know what you're looking
	for they can be a good place to pick up cards. One seller, 
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ebay.com/fdbk/feedback_profile/mrmystery">MrMystery</a>,
	has a large number of singles available not just on eBay but a lot more he doesn't list.
	Another seller, 
	<a target=_blank" href="https://www.ebay.com/fdbk/feedback_profile/pbmexpressusa">PBMExpress</a>, 
	has quite a few Booster Boxes available. While he lists only 1-2 of each available, when they sell
	he renews the listing with another one or relists a new set, and has been doing this for years.
	There are 
	<a target=_blank" href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&_nkw=galactic+empires+-aldiss+-anthology+-dozois+-clarke+-rebellion">a number of other sellers</a>
	with various starters, boosters, singles, and mixed lots of cards available.</p>

	<p class="text">The best place to start is with <b>Primary Edition (Series II)</b>. Starters and Booster
	Boxes are still readily available and cheap and you can get a good base of cards for deck building from
	them. However, the Starters each contain 50 fixed cards, with just 5 random uncommon cards per deck. Getting
	more than a couple of each Primary starter deck doesn't get you much variety. Given the prices, getting
	maybe one Starter Display Box, containing 12 Decks, 6 of each of the two variants, may be worth it,
	but definately not more than that. Booster have their own
	issue with card distribution, which I explain <a href="#RaritiesAndDistribution">below</a>;
	in short, Very Rare cards were split into two groupings and cards from only one grouping or the other
	show up in an entire booster box; this issue is further exacerbated by the fact that most of the
	sellers with stock today only have booster boxes with cards from Group 1 of the two groupings, 
	and Group 2 is the grouping which conains all the most powerful ship cards in the set. So it can
	be difficult to get the Strength 7-10 ships and Dragons for several of the empires, not to mention
	other more powerful VR cards.</p>

	<p class="text">The next best set to get is <b>Universe Edition (Series U)</b>. It is a lot
	pricier today than it
	used to be, but has a good mix of cards, espeically ships from the main empires. In particular, 
	the Universe Edition starter decks contain 15-19 ships, plus a few support cards, for one empire
	and a large number of Very
	Rare and Rare cards. In fact, each Starter has basically 8 booster packs worth of VR and R cards.
	Each Starter has a window on the back side which reveals one empire specific card, letting you
	know which of the empires the deck contains.</p>

	<p class="text">However, you need to be careful because all starter decks from later sets also
	say &quot;Universe Edition.&quot;
	The Starters from <b>Galactic Invaders</b> and <b>Allied Forces</b> are extermely hard to come by, so
	if you happen across any of these for a good price then get them. However, <b>Comedy Club</b> starters
	are still relatively common and don't contain the same kind of card mix that other starters
	do. They can be worth collecting, but they are not as good as other Universe Edition Starters for
	building your initial colletion for deck building. You can tell the Comedy Club starters by the
	<a data-lightbox="Cards" href="images/cards/100dpiSharp/Misc/Starters/CC_Starter.jpg">Road Signs</a>
	card that always shows through the window.</p>

	<p class="text">After Universe, the next best sets for deck building are <b>New Empires
	(Series III)</b> and <b>Time Gates (Series V)</b>. New Empires Boosters are hard to come by and
	relatively expensive, making it less suitable for initially collecting these days.
	New Empires Starters, on the other hand,
	are relatively easy to find, but all contain the same 50 fixed cards, making getting more than a
	couple decks pointless. Time Gates is a very good set with a nice mix of power and interesting
	cards and boxes are less expensive. But, given the choice between starting with 2-3 Time Gates
	Booster Boxes and 1 Universe Edition Booster Box the Universe box will give you a better mix of
	cards off the bat, including the main empire ship cards you need to build a deck. Time Gates
	boxes will give you more and better cards to expand your
	collection's deck building capabilities. So get 1-2 Universe Edition booster boxes or a handful
	of Primary Edition booster boxes before getting some Time Gates. Then get the Time Gates booster
	boxes to expand the deck building choices.</p>

	<p class="text">The next couple sets worth getting are <b>Advanced Technologies (Series VI)</b> and
	<b>Piracy (Series VII)</b>. Both of these sets offer a good mix of power cards and minor empire cards.
	Advanced Technologies also offers good power cards to expand the core empires found in Primary, New
	Empires, and Universe while Piracy centers on the Piracy theme and introduces several minor
	Pirate empires, expanding on only one of the minor empires found in the earlier sets (the Bolaar).
	The main drawback of these two sets is that the only seller with any available is selling booster
	boxes for nearly double the price you can get Universe booster boxes for, and 6x the price of
	Primary booster boxes, making these two sets more of a nice expansion to a collection than
	necessary purchases to play the game.</p>

	<p class="text"><b>Comedy Club on the Far Side of the Galaxy (Series VIII)</b> can be a decent
	set to collect and it's relatively easy to get more
	than enough cards to build a deck with. Each starter contains the same assortment of cards;
	about 75 of the cards are identical and fixed in every starter while the other 25 cards are
	identical but have a different quote on them. There are 4 Entity cards which show up 1 per
	Starter, so the only real variety between Starters is the Entity. Each deck contains enough
	Comedy Club Network Empire cards to build a decent deck. Two Starters will get you enough to
	tweak it. 3-4 Starters is
	far more than enough other than collecting all of the card variants and all four Entity
	rarity cards. It can be a good addition to a collection once you are
	starting to look for more cards to get, it's just not a great place to start.</p>

	<p class="text">Despite its price and availibility <b>Powers of the Mind (Series IV)</b> is not
	a great set for core deck
	building. It introduces three new empires which are only found in this set and which play very
	differently than any of the other empires since all three are crew-based empires rather than
	being ship-based like all of the others. The good thing here, though, is that 1-2 Booster
	Boxes should give you more than enough cards to build decent decks for each of the three empires,
	So if you do decide to get some it's not that expensive to try to make it work.</p>

	<p class="text">If you happen across any <b>Persona (Series IX)</b> Booster Boxes,
	<b>Galactic Invaders (Series X)</b> Starters or Booster Boxes, or <b>Allied Forces (Series XI)</b>
	Starters for a good price then get them. They are rare and valuable, and you can easily trade or
	sell them to get other cards. Otherwise, don't worry about them unless you get very deep into collecting.</p>

	<p class="text">There are tons of Promotional cards available. Galactic Empires had more Promo cards
	than any other game for a decade after it's release. Many of these cards are "power" cards,
	basically because the company allowed people to design their own cards, adding features by paying
	extra. So some of the top players, distributors, and retail stores ordered power cards which they
	could play with or sell to tournament players for a premium price. Many of these can be a good
	addition to a collection, but they are more expensive to acquire than acquiring bulk cards from
	booster boxes and get you less variety. These cards are largely for serious collectors.</p>


<div id="RaritiesAndDistribution" style="clear: both;"></div>
	<h2>On Rarities and Card Distribution</a></h2>

	<p class="text">Most CCGs use a separate print plate to print a sheet of cards for each rarity
	level, with each sheet for each rarity level being printed a different number of times. For
	instance, for every Rare sheet there might be four Uncommon sheets and ten Common sheets printed.
	Typical companies have print plates with 10x10, 10x11, or 11x11 cards on a single plate. This varied
	from company to company and sometimes from expansion to expansion, depending on which printer company
	the game producer used for a given expansion. As one example of how cards are typically printed,
	a standard deck of playing cards has 13 cards of
	four suits, for 52 cards, plus 2 Jokers and 1 Rules card for a total of 55 cards.
	Thus two decks of playing cards are usually printed on
	a single 10x11 print sheet.</p>

	<p class="text">For most, if not all, of its run
	Galactic Empires used a 10x10 print sheet. For smaller sets the cards would be
	printed twice on a single sheet. For larger sets each was prited only once on a print sheet.
	The exact layout varied from set to set. Entities were typically printed once on a Very Rare sheet
	while Very Rare cards were printed twice on the same sheet, resulting in Entities being twice as
	rare as Very Rare cards within the set.</p>

	<p class="text">One other thing that I will note is that in offset printing (large printing presses) the most expensive
	part of the process is in setting up the printer for a run. Especially on 4 or 7 color printers, where each color needs
	its own set of plates, so it is cheaper to try to lay the cards out in a way where you reduce the total number of
	different print runs you must do. Most CCGs need at least one run for each rarity, but it is possible to "cheat" a little
	by printing some cards from a lower rarity multiple times on a higher rarity sheet. For instance, if you print 3 or 4 copies
	of a card on a Rare sheet then you've effctively decreased the rarity of that card to an Uncommon.</p>

	<p class="text">All of the print plate/print sheet layout descriptions I give here are purely conjectual, which
	I've discerned using my knowledge of the printing process and rarity levels of Galactic Empires cards.
	It is possible I am incorrect on some of the information presented below.</p>


	<h3>PRIMARY EDITION</h3>
	<h4>STARTER &AMP; BOOSTER DISTRIBUTION</h4>

	<p class="text">Primary Edition Starters have a fixed set
	of 50 cards each, plus 5 random Uncommon cards. These fixed cards were considered
	Common cards by Companion, and taken into consideration when determining which
	cards were designated as Common for the entire set. This means that a large chunk
	of the Common cards were
	packaged into the two starter decks, with relatively fewer being packaged into
	the Booster Packs. In Booster Packs these cards were slightly less common than
	the Uncommon cards, and were intermixed with Uncommon cards in the pack
	position.</p>

	<p class="text">Booster Packs each have 12 cards. Starting with position #1 with the
	cards face up, Uncommons were in position 1-6, Commons in position 7-9,
	Rares in position 10-11, and Very-Rares or (1 per box) an Entity in position 12. Booster Boxes
	contained 36 packs, so you should get 35 VR and 1 Entity per box, though some packs seem to have
	replaced an Uncommon with the Entity, meaning you could get 36 VR per box plus the Entity.</p>
	
	
	<h4>COMMON: VC / CA / CB / CAB</h4>

	<p class="text">On the cards lists on my site cards marked as <b>CA</b> were Common cards found
	only in <b>Basic Deck A.</b> 
	Cards marked as <b>CB</b> were Common cards found only in <b>Basic Deck B.</b>
	Cards marked as <b>CAB</b> were Common cards found
	in both <b>Basic Decks A &amp; B</b>.</p>

	<p class="text">The original card list from <a href="GalacticFire/GalacticIntercom2.pdf">Galactic Inercom #2</a>
	listed 15 cards as Very Common (<b>VC</b>) and 70 cards as Common (<b>C</b>). If the Very Common cards each
	appeared twice on a print sheet and the Common each appear once this would make a 100 card print sheet.
	This is kind of odd, since the Very Common cards mostly, but don't comletely, line up with the <b>CAB</b> cards found
	in both <b>Basic Decks</b>. There is also one <b>C</b> card that doesn't go in either <b>Basic Deck</b>, even
	though the easiest way to make the two decks would have been to print all 50 cards for each deck on a single sheet,
	then split the sheet with 50 cards going in to <b>Deck A</b> and 50 into <b>Deck B</b>. It is, however, possible that
	this single card appeared twice on the Uncommon print sheet, however there are already exactly 100 Uncommon cards, so
	there's no room to do this.</p>

	<p class="text">All in all, I just don't know and can't know without seeing a print sheet how exactly the cards were
	organized. I've listed these Very Common cards as both <b>VC</b> as well the appropriate deck they appeared in, e.g.
	<b>VCAB</b> is a Very Common that appeared in both <b>Deck A</b> and <b>Deck B</b>.</p>


	<h4>UNCOMMON &AMP; RARE: <b>U</b> / <b>R</b></h4>
	<p class="text">There were 100 of each of the Uncommon and Rare cards, meaning they were
	certainly each printed on their own sheet.</p>


	<h4>VERY RARE: <b>V1</b> / <b>V2</b></h4>
	<p class="text">In Primary Edition the Very Rare cards were produced in two distinct groupings.
	Each booster box would contain Very Rare cards from only one grouping or the other. Group 1,
	designated <b>V1</b> by me in my card lists, consists of 45 Very Rare cards containing
	mostly non-empire specific cards. Group 2, designated <b>V2</b>, consists of 100 Very Rare
	cards which contained almost all of the more powerful empire specific ships and
	some other empire specific support cards in
	the set.</p>

	<p class="text">This was likely caused by a number of miscommunications between Companion
	Games and the company that printed the cards. The cards were printed using
	printing plates which contained 10x10 cards on them, for a total of 100 cards on a sheet.
	Group 2 contained 100 unique cards, but Group 1 cards were likely printed on a
	sheet which contained two copies of each of the 45 <b>V1</b>, the 9 Entity cards, and
	most likely the C4 War Veteran filling the last spot on the sheet. When the
	cards were cut the Entities and War Veteran were set aside. At this point the
	two groupings of Very Rare cards should have been mixed together before
	packaging them into booster boxes, but instead the printer packaged booster
	boxes with Very Rare cards from only one grouping or the other in them.</p>

	<p class="text">To make matters worse Booster Boxes filled with Very Rare cards from Group 2
	seem to be more rare than Booster Boxes from Group 1. It is possible this was caused by a number
	of factors, first being that the Printer may have printed an incorrect number of
	each grouping. Since Group 1 had two sets of each Very Rare on it this group
	should have been printed in half the quantity as Group 2 was, but it looks like
	the two groups may have been printed in equal numbers, making <b>V1</b> cards twice as
	common as <b>V2</b> cards. If this did indeed happen it is likely that Companion Games
	kept the two groupings of Booster Boxes separate and tried to sell them at a
	rate that kept the two groupings of Very Rare cards equal when the game was new.
	This would have resulted in their Warehouse having considerably more Group 1
	boxes than Group 2 Boxes when the company went Bankrupt. This may have been
	further exacerbated by the liquidators and buyers of the remaining stock not
	realizing there were two groupings. In the late 1990's and early 2000's a number
	of suppliers dumped Primary Edition Booster Boxes and Cases on eBay for a very
	cheap price, and it is likely that whomever picked up most of the Group 2
	booster boxes was one of the people who sold cheap back then. The cheapest case I 
	bought in 2006 was from a vendor selling Group 2 booster boxes for around $36 including shipping.
	This seems to have resulted in a situation where most resellers today, in the year 2022,
	have Booster Boxes which contain only Group 1 Very Rare cards.</p>

	<p class="text">Note that the distribution of other cards - Common, Uncommon, regular Rare,
	and Entity cards - was not affected by this bifurcation of the Very Rare cards.</p>


	<h3>NEW EMPIRES</h3>
	<p class="text">Each of the four base rarity levels (Common/Uncommon/Rare/Very Rare) in New Empires
	had exactly 50 cards, meaning that
	the print sheets likely contained two copies of each of the 50 cards. This leaves the
	Entities to be placed on their own print sheet; likely the sheet also contained many of
	the 29 Promotional cards that were printed in this time frame, some of which were printed
	with differing "rarities," for example given away with magazines with 7 out of 8 being one card
	and the 8th being another card. Or they may have prined one copy of the Very Rare cards, one copy of
	each Entity, and filled the other 40 slots with Promotional cards. It's impossible to know now without
	either talking to somebody to worked there or finding an uncut print sheet for the set.</p>


	<h3>POWERS OF THE MIND</h3>

	<p class="text">Powers of the Mind had three base rarity levels. Uncommon and Rare each had 50 cards,
	with each appearing twice on their respective print sheets.</p>

	<p class="text">There were 48 Very Rare cards, each of which appeared twice on the VR sheet, leaving
	space for the 4 Entities. This made distributing the Entities much easier, as you could
	just package cards on a VR sheet into boosters in order and for every 100 cards you'd
	fill 100 boosters, which filled 2.77 booster boxes ensuring that every booster box had at least
	one entity, with some boxes having two. In fact, 11 out of every 25 boxes should have
	contained two Entities.</p>

	<p class="text">Booster Packs have 12 cards. The Very Rare or Entity are in Position 1.
	Uncommons are in Position 2-8. Rares are in Position 9-12. This means that the ratio of cards
	printed are <b>1E:2V:8R:14U</b>. That is, for each copy of each Entity printed there were two copies
	of each Very Rare, eight copies of each Rare, and fourteen copies of each Uncommon.
	There were no Common cards in the set.</p>


	<h3>TIME GATES</h3>
	<h4>RARE: R1 / R2</h4>

	<p class="text">Like the other sets, Time Gates was printed on sheets of 100 cards.
	Common and Uncommon each had 50 cards, meaning that
	each card appeared twice on a print sheet. For the Rare cards 45 of the cards
	were printed twice, while 10 of the cards appeared only once making them Extra Rare
	compared to the other Rare cards. These 10 cards were the 10 versions of the
	Shipping Delays card; so while each individual card is twice as Rare as the
	other Rare cards, the card as a whole was 5x more common than the other Rare
	cards. These cards are designated as <b>R1</b> in my card list because they appear once
	on the print sheet; the other 45 Rare cards are designated as <b>R2</b> because they appear twice.</p>

	<p class="text">There were 48 Very Rare cards, each of which appeared twice on the VR sheet, leaving
	space for the 4 Entities. This made distributing the Entities much easier, as you could
	just package cards on a VR sheet into boosters in order and for every 100 cards you'd
	fill 100 boosters, which filled 2.77 booster boxes ensuring that every booster box had at least
	one entity, with some boxes having two. In fact, 11 out of every 25 boxes should have
	contained two Entities.</p>

	<p class="text">Booster Packs have 12 cards. The Very Rare or Entity are in Position 1.
	Uncommons are in Position 2-8. Rares are in Position 9-12. This means that the ratio of cards
	printed are <b>1E:2V:4R1:8R2:14U</b>.</p>

	<h3>UNIVERSE EDITION</h3>
	<h4>VERY COMMON: VC<br>
	COMMON: C2<br>
	UNCOMMON: U2 / U3 / U4<br>
	RARE: R2 / R3 / R4<br>
	VERY RARE: V3 / V4</h4>

	<p class="text">Universe Edition was an extremely large core set, so to help ensure that 
	cards were more evenly distributed across all booster packs Companion Games 
	set up theme positions within the packs. Each booster box contained 36 packs.
	Each pack contained the following:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Position #1 is a Very Rare (35:36) or Entity (1:36). Some boxes may have contained two entities.</li>
	<li>Position #2 contains a random Terrain from Group 2, one card that's either <b>VC</b>, <b>C2</b>, <b>U2</b> or <b>R2</b>.
			There are no <b>V2</b> groupings in Universe Edition.</li>
	<li>Position #3 contains a random <b>U3</b>, <b>R3</b>, or <b>V3</b> card, which
			consisted of Ships and a few support cards for
			the Clydon, P.O.T., Scorpead, Tufor, or Vektrean Empires.</li>
	<li>Position #4 contains a random <b>U4</b>, <b>R4</b>, or <b>V4</b> card, which
			consisted of ships and a few support cards for
			the Argonian, Corporate, Krebiz, Mechad, or Space Dragon Empires.</li>
	<li>Positions #6-7 contains two Rares from the base card pool (<b>R0</b>).</li>
	<li>Positions #5 &amp; #8-14 are a mix of Common and Uncommon cards from the base group (<b>C0</b> &amp; <b>U0</b>).</li>
	<li><b>C0</b>, <b>U0</b>, <b>R0</b>, and <b>V0</b> technically don't exist; To allow for proper sorting within my
			Interactive Card List and Gallery as well as to differentiate from the theme cards I have placed
			cards that were not part of these three groupings, and thus were in the &quot;base set,&quot;
			in <b>C0</b>, <b>U0</b>, <b>R0</b>, or <b>V0.</b></li>
	</ul>

	<p class="text">While this seems very complex and potentially problematic, the result was
	actually a fairly well balanced distribution of cards. Much better than Primary
	Edition had. This does, however, make it difficult to discern how the print sheets
	were laid out. However, there is a little that can be figured out:

	<ul>
		<li>
			There are 54 base Common cards (<b>C0</b>) and 88 base Uncommon cards (<b>U0</b>); These are cards
			that aren't part of Group 2-4 cards.
			Likely 50 of the Common cards were printed twice each on a Common sheet while the
			other 4 cards were printed three times each on the Uncommon sheet. Since Commons and Uncommons
			were mixed together in both boosters and starters it wouldn't have mattered that they were
			mixed on the printed sheets.
		</li>
		<li><div id="PrintSheet2"></div>Group 2 consists entirely of Terrain. This sheet is used to pack Starters full of
				Terrain as well as fill Position #2 in boosters. In Starters there are eight groups of three cards each
				filled from this group, for a total of 24 Terrain cards (plus any extra Terrain pulled from the other
				slots, mostly <b>R0</b> and <b>V0</b>).
			<ul>
				<li>
					There have been several card lists that have different rarities
					for Terrain in this set. The list from <a href="GalacticFire/GalacticFire1.pdf">Galactic Fire #1</a>
					lists 5 Terrain as Very Common. While I can find no contemporary reference for it now, 
					<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nslists.com/jafsfh.htm#ccg">Jeff Allender's House of Checklists</a>
					notes that these cards should be Uncommon. However, I believe that Jeff is incorrect in this assessment.
					These cards show up far more often in my collection than an Uncommon would suggest.
				</li>
				<li>
					However, if I assume that the card list in GF1 is correct and that Group 2 consists of Very Common, Common,
					Uncommon, and Rare cards I can pretty much reconstruct the print sheet based on what I've seen in Starters.
					I wind up with 5 Very Common (<b>VC</b>), 14 Commons (<b>C2</b>), 11 Uncommons (<b>U2</b>), and 16 Rares
					(<b>R2</b>). Assuming that the ratio of cards on a print sheet is <b>4VC:3C2:2U2:1R2</b> we wind up with
					100 cards on a print sheet. However, to get 16 Rares we have to assume that T5 Penteir System is a <b>R2</b>
					(Jeff's Checklist puts it as a <b>R0</b> not an <b>R2</b>) and that the T/B5 Vektrean Asteroid Outpost
					shows up both on the R3 sheet and the R2 sheet. Without moving Pentier to be an <b>R2</b> there would be 101
					<b>R0</b> cards, so reassigning makes for a nice neat 100 card <b>R0</b> print sheet too.
					<ul>
						<li><u>(5*4) + (14*3) + (11*2) + 16</u> = <u>(20 + 42) + (22 + 16)</u> = <u>62 + 38</u> = 100</li>
					</ul>
					This does seem to satisfy the layout of a print sheet, and the Very Common cards do seem to show up
					in my collection more often than the Common 2 or Uncommon 2 Terrain. I don't know how to properly explain
					this or the fact that in the Starters I recently opened I had a couple T/B5 Vektrean
					Asteroid Outpost and a T5 Pentier System come with the Group 2 Terrain if they aren't on the Group 2 sheet.
					I've mocked up an example print sheet for <a href="PrintSheet/UEGroup2.html">Group 2</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		</li>
		<li><div id="PrintSheet3"></div>Group 3 and Group 4 were theme groups, and each group had its own print sheet. These
			sheets were used to fill theme positions #3 &amp; #4 in the booster packs, however they were primarily used to
			fill the 20 empire specific cards in a Universe Edition Starter Deck. Each sheet contained 20 cards for
			each of the five empires in the group, so one print sheet could be cut into 5 starters.
			Very Rare cards appear once on a sheet; Rare cards twice; Uncommon cards three times.
			I've mocked up an example print sheet
			for <a href="PrintSheet/UEGroup3.html">Group 3</a>
			and <a href="PrintSheet/UEGroup4.html">Group 4</a>;
			this is just how I imagine the cards
			might have been layed out. If cut vertically you would get the 5 Starter Deck cores;
			if cut horizontally you could fill boosters without needing to randomize the cards
			to get a decent mix of cards.
		<ul>
				<li>In Group 3 there are 13 <b>U3</b>, 18 <b>R3</b>, and 25 <b>V3</b> cards. If these 
				appeared at a ratio of <b>3U:2R:1V</b>
				card on a sheet then this would have resulted in a print sheet with 100 cards.
					<ul>
						<li><u>(13*3) + (18*2) + 25</u> = <u>39 + 36 + 25</u> = <u>75 + 25</u> = 100</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>In Group 4 there are 7 <b>U4</b>, 20 <b>R4</b>, and 39 <b>V4</b> cards. Again,
				given the <b>3U:2R:1V</b>
				ratio this would have been a print sheet with 100 cards.
					<ul>
						<li><u>(7*3) + (20*2) + 39</u> = <u>21 + 40 + 39</u> = <u>61 + 39</u> = 100</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		<li>There are 100 base Rare cards (<b>R0</b>; or in other words Rare cards that aren't part of <b>R2</b>,
			<b>R3</b>, or <b>R4</b> sets). These would have had their own print sheet.</li>
		<li>There are 45 base Very Rare cards (<b>V0</b>) that have UV/Black Light reactive ink,
			plus all 10 Entities have UV/Black Light effects. This means that these 45 cards
			were arranged twice
			on a VR print sheet, while the Entities appeared once each.</li>
		<li>There are 145 base VR cards in total, meaning that the other 100 VR
			cards were printed on their own print sheet.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="text">Starter Decks are divided into two sections of cards; 20 cards which are empire specific,
	and 80 cards which are a mix of Group 2 Terrain cards and other card from the general pool of Universe Edition. This
	is true of Galactic Invaders and Allied Forces Starter Decks as well, which also contained Universe Edition cards
	in the second section.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>The first section consisted of 20 cards of one empire taken from either the Group 3 or Group 4
			print sheet. Uncommon cards appear three times; Rare cards twice; Very Rare cards once.</li>
		<li>The other 80 cards are divided into eight groups of ten cards
			each. Each group has:
			<ul>
				<li>One <b>V0</b> Very Rare card taken from the base group</li>
				<li>Two <b>R0</b> Rare cards taken from the base group</li>
				<li>Three Terrain cards taken from the Group 2 print sheet (<b>VC</b>, <b>C2</b>, <b>U2</b> or
					<b>R2</b> cards).
				</li>
				<li>A mix of four more <b>C0</b> Common and/or <b>U0</b> Uncommon cards at a ratio of roughly one
					Uncommon for every two Commons.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>This means a full Universe Starter has 8 <b>V0</b> Very Rares, 16 <b>R0</b> Rares, 24 Group 2 Terrains,
			and 32 other cards consisting of roughly 9-12 <b>U0</b> Uncommon and 18-22 <b>C0</b> Common cards.
		</li>
		</ul>

	<p class="text">So to sum things up, Universe Edition has a total of 564 cards on 8 print sheets.
		<ol>
		<li>Common Sheet, likely containing 50 of the C0 rarity cards, printed twice each.</li>
		<li>Uncommon Sheet, containing all 88 of the U0 rarity cards, plus the remaining 4 of the C0 cards printed 3x each.</li>
		<li>Rare Sheet, containing all 100 R0 rarity cards.</li>
		<li>Very Rare Sheet 1, containing 100 of the V0 rarity cards.</li>
		<li>Very Rare Sheet 2, containing the other 45 V0 rarity cards, each printed twice, plus all
				10 Entity cards.</li>
		<li>Terrain Theme Sheet, containing all 5 VC, 14 C2, 11 U2, &amp; 16 R2 cards.</li>
		<li>Empire Theme Sheet A, which contained 13 U3, 18 R3, and 25 V3 cards from the Clydon, P.O.T., Scorpead,
			Tufor, and Vektrean Empires.</li>
		<li>Empire Theme Sheet B, which contained 7 U4, 20 R4, and 39 V4 cards from the Argonian, Corporate,
			Krebiz, Mechad, or Space Dragon Empires.</li>
		</ol>

	<h3>ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
	<p class="text">Like the other sets, each print sheet held 10x10 cards. The Uncommon print sheet
	had two copies of each of the 50 Uncommon cards. The Rare print sheet has two copies of each
	of the 48 Rare cards and four copies of the single Common card in the set; since it
	was located on the Rare sheet this is why it sometimes replaces a Rare in a booster pack. The
	Very Rare sheet had two copies of each of the 47 VR cards and one copy of each of the
	6 Entities. Each booster pack is supposed to contain 6 Uncommons, 4 Rares (or Common), and
	2 Very Rare. This leads me to believe that every booster box contains 2 Entities, and 4 out
	of every 25 boxes may contain 3 Entities. Booster Boxes had 36 packs of 12 cards. I don't
	know the pack positions, but each booster has 6 Uncommon, 4 Rare, and 2 Very-Rare or Entity cards.</p>


	<h3>PIRACY</h3>

	<p class="text">Piracy contained only two rarity levels, each of which had exactly 100 cards and would
	have each been given their own print sheet. So here, again, the Entities were put on 
	their own print sheet, likely with some of the Promotional cards that were produced in
	this time period. Piracy changed to having 6 cards per booster, with 1 Very-Rare and 5 Uncommon
	cards. Booster Boxes contained 80 boosters, with one booster containing an Entity.</p>

	<p class="text">All of the Piracy cards used UV reactive ink, resulting in some interesting
	looking cards when held under a blacklight. In fact, the UV ink looked significantly better than
	the "night glo" visuals used in Universe Edition. Promotional Set 3 &amp; 4 along with some cards
	from Comedy Club also had UV ink, so there may have been some cards from those sets printed along
	with the Piracy Entities.</p>


	<h3>COMEDY CLUB ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE GALAXY</h3>

	<p class="text">This set consisted of Starters with exactly 100 cards; 1 Entity and 99 other cards.
	There are 4 different Entities and 101 functionally different cards. However many of the cards have
	up to four different versions with differnet quotes on them and one of the cards has two different
	image versions. These different versions were placed in different
	starters. It is likely that each Starter had its own print sheet. I do not know whether or
	not there was any randomization of the entities or other cards between starters, but it seems
	unlikely as that would introduce more steps (and cost) for what could have been a very simple
	expansion to print and package.</p>

	<h3>PERSONA</h3>

	<p class="text">Like Piracy, the Persona set contained only two rarity levels, each of which had 
	exactly 100 cards and would have each been given their own print sheet. So, like Piracy, the Entities
	were put on their own print sheet, likely with some of the Promotional cards that were produced in
	this time period. Persona Entities also have UV reactive ink.</p>


	<h3>GALACTIC INVADERS</h3>
	<h4>COMMON: C2<br>
	UNCOMMON: U0 / U2<br>
	RARE: R2<br>
	VERY RARE: V0 / V2</h4>

	<p class="text">This set was released as Booster Boxes and a set of five Starter Decks, one for
	each of the five empires introduced in this set.</p>

	<p class="text">I have don't much information on this set, just barely enough to guess at the
	card sheet layouts. There are 2 Common, 105 Uncommon, 21 Rare, 125 Very-Rare, and 6 Entities.
	Some of these cards likely only appeared in the Starters; the two Commons, for instance,
	are both J'xar Starter ships which I believe appeared 4x each in the starter deck. I was able to 
	reconstruct the 21 cards that appear in the Orgon and Zedan starters based on an early list of
	cards that I had. I recently opened an Aqaaran and Gekonauak starter, so have a correct list of
	the cards in those
	starters. For the J'xar I was able to take a reasonable guess based on the quantity I have (from
	a lot I bought which appears to be from several starters) and the rarities.</p>
	
	<p class="text">There are 21 empire specific cards in each starter, 20 ships
	and empire specific equipment and terrain plus the Sector HQ. The other 80 cards in a starter
	are Universe
	Edition cards arranged just like the UE starters, with 8 groupings of 10 cards each, each grouping
	containing 1 VR0, 2 R0, 3 cards from the Group 2 Terrain sheet, and 4 C0 or U0 cards.</p>
	
	<p class="text">On the <a id="GIStarter" href="PrintSheet/GIStarter.html">GI starter sheet</a>
	there are 2 <b>C2</b> appearing four times each, 4 <b>U2</b>
	appearing three times each, 22 <b>R2</b> appearing twice each, and 36 <b>V2</b> appearing once
	each. The 5 Sector HQ cards likely appear on the V0 sheet, but were separated and added to the
	starters.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><u>(2*4) + (4*3) + (22*2) + 36</u> = <u>(8 + 12) + (44 + 36)</u> = <u>20 + 80</u> = 100</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="text">The other cards likely appeared only in booster packs; 
	there are 100 Uncommon cards listed as <b>U0</b> and 83 Very Rare <b>V0</b>. The
	Very Rare sheet likely had the 6 Entities and 5 Sector HQ cards. What else could have been on
	the sheet I'm not sure, possibly the HQ cards appeared twice which would bring the card total up
	to 99 cards.</p>



	<h3>ALLIED FORCES</h3>

	<p class="text">Allied Forces was relesed as a set of 12 Starter Decks, one for each empire in
	the set. Each starter contained up to 20 empire specific cards. Decks with fewer than 20 empire
	specific cards were filled out with a number of non-empire Bases, Monster, Occurences, and
	Terrain which I'm not sure if they were randomly distributed or if every starter has the same cards.</p>
	
	<p class="text">In most of the starters one of the cards
	was the Sector HQ and another was a rules cards; The Corporate Pirate deck didn't have a HQ;
	the Noble empire contained a number of generic
	ships and a second Sector HQ instead of a rules card. The Bolaar, Corporate Pirate, and Leopan
	each contained a number of ship and/or empire specific cards from the Piracy set plus 2 new
	ships unique to their Allied Forces starters. As with other starters Rare cards appeared
	twice in a starter while Very Rare cards appear once each.</p>

	<h2>Card Lists (Excel Spreadsheet)</h2>

	<p class="text">I have a complete card list available to download, in Excel 2000 or Excel 2007+ format. 
	In each file is two sheets; has the Quantity columns blank while the other is filled out with my cards (including 
	cards I'm seeking and cards I'm willing to trade. The leftmost three columns contain a number sequence for sorting; 
	if you sort by the first column each set will be seperated out into different sections. The second column sorts 
	all cards together by type then strength. The third column is the same as the second, except that the German Gold 
	Border set is moved to the bottom of the list instead of being mixed into the rest; the third column is the default 
	sorting method the sheet starts in. Of course, you can sort the tables in any other manner you wish, and these three 
	columns will allow you to return them to the default sorting order.</p>

				<p class="text">It is difficult to tell cards from the various expansions
				from one another, even to someone familiar with these cards. Companion Games
				never tried to make it easy to differentiate the various expansion sets as some
				other companies did. A quick rundown of the major differences:<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Series I (Alpha &amp; Beta)</b>  have a textured/dimpled surface;
				later sets had a smooth surface much like most other CCGs.<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Series II (Primary Edition) &amp; Series III (New Empires)</b>
				 have a narrow white card border measuring 1/16th inch, with no border between the white border
				 and the card itself. The card images also have
				a wide colored border around them.<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Series U (Universe Edition), Series IV (Powers of the Mind)</b>
				and all later sets have a wider white card border measuring 1/8th inch. In addition
				there is a thin beveled border between the white border and the card. The image border was
				also replaced with a thin beveled edge for most of the cards reprinted in
				later sets, though a few cards retained the larger colored border.<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Differences between individual cards which were reprinted from one
				of the later sets into one of the other later sets are difficult to tell and
				usually must be done on a card-by-card basis, identifying minor art changes or
				rules corrections. As of the most recent update I have posted scans of almost all cards
				from every edition to make it easier to distinguish between them.</p>
