uninhabitable.

The Clydon race is composed of several highly distinctive sub-races (called broods). Each brood type is bred to fulfill a specific need
of the whole of Clydon society. The various brood affiliations also serve as the basis of the Clydon caste system. Drones are gigantic
beings designed to do perform manual labor; the Blood are the warriors of Clydon society and are bred to be vicious and without fear in
the face of the enemy; the Imperial brood are the elite caste of the Clydon race and rule all others.

<h3 align="center">Human</h3>
<p>
Humans, too, exist on the Far Side. They do not appear to live within a single, cohesive society. Rather, they seem to have organized
several competing empires of which the most notable are the Corporate Agressor and Plasma Occupied Territories.

<h3 align="center">Indirigan</h3>
<p>
The various Indirigan tribes constitute a race of brightly-hued, extremely aggressive humanoids. Their society is apparently patriarchial,
treating females as little more than prized possessions. The presence of a much sought-after on an opposing ship has often brought
doom to a ship as the crew finds itself unwilling to defend itself, lest the female be damaged. To avoid these situations, the Indirigans
have developed for a fondness for face-to-face warfare. 'Social combat' has become their pre-emminent form of interaction.

The Krebiz are a race of aquatic crusteaceans originating on a world with over 90% of its surface covered with water. They resemble a giant
terrestrial hermit crab. Friendly traders by nature, they act only to protect their territory and access to various lucrative trading posts
and lobster breeding grounds.
</p>
<p>
The design of Krebiz ships betrays the physical nature of the Krebiz themselves: the combination of carrier ship and capsule mimicks that of
a hermit crab and its borrowed, and disposable, shell. The Krebiz themselves are formidable and surprisingly swift in personal combat.
