<u>June 30, 2006</u>
<b>NOTICE!</b> I am relocating from the West Coast to the East Coast. One of the results of the move is that I will be
changing my ISP. Which means this site is going away. It will most likely remain up until at least the end of July.
I suggest you get whatever it is you want from the site before then. I haven't played the game for several years now.
By how long it's been since I updated, you might notice my interest has sort of waned. It's a great game, and I wish
hadn't suffered the fate that it did. Since I don't see myself playing again for the forseeable future I'm going to
let the site and my collection go. If anyone is interested in hosting it, I can forward the entire content of the
site in a neat little package.
</p>
<p>
<u>August 31, 2001</u>
There was a suggestion of a discussion forum. Since it is cheap and easy, I've added the very thing.
</p>
<small>
<p>
<u>June 14, 2001</u>
As you may have noticed, I'm rather neglecting the site. It has been four years since Companion Games ceased to be, and I've
played maybe twice in the past year. I think it is one of the best card games you could possibly play, but the "community" is
rather stagnant. I'm planning to finish out the various sections as I had originally envisioned and then I'll probably pretty much
ignore the site unless someone submits interesting strategy tips or the game should somehow return from the dead. I appreciate
everyone's support and feedback that I've gotten over the years. I'm pretty sure you all weren't expecting anything more to be
done, so this will be a pleasant surprise for you. I don't plan on taking the site down for the forseeable future, so I hope it continues
to be of use to the, oh I don't know, 3 of 4 people who know about it ^_^ And I still need the same cards I did back in September (see
below). Sigh.
</p>
<p>
This time around, I've added more of the card lists, fixed up all kinds of embarrassing grammer and spelling errors (I'm sure
many remain), added a few more strategy bits from old e-mail that I never got around to putting in, posted an electronic copy
of the last rule set and a few more things. There may be one more update after this one, I'm not sure. If there is, it will be to add
an on-line version of the various FAQs and errata that were published in <i>Galactic Intercom</i>.
</p>
<p>
<u>December 14, 1999</u>
You came here because you got a NetMinder update, didn't you? All I've done is update the links at the bottom of the page.
</p>
<p>
<u>December 4, 1999</u>
It was pointed out to me that with Tony's pages evidently gone, the best card lists that were available are out of circulation. Unfortunately,
I never snarfed copies for myself. However, I am putting together a set of lists to put up here. The first few are now available. I have also
made some changes behind the scenes to how I have the pages structured on the servers. I don't think I broke anything, but you never
know.
</p>
<p>
<u>December 2, 1999</u>
A few little things here and there. Some additions to card combos and the travelogue, mostly. Thanks to Bob Peterson for some of the
tidbits. And seeing as how I get questions periodically about the future (or lack thereof) of the game, I'm reposting a link to
<a href="cg.txt">Carl's Schulte's letter</a> that he sent out right after the liquidation of Companion Games.
</p>
<p>
The real reason for changing this page was to remove the link to Anthony Medici's sales site. Apparently the server is down for an
extended period or he has gotten out of the business.
</p>
<p>
<u>September 16, 1999</u>
Nothing grand this time either, just got some more spoilers for promo cards. Thanks go to Brian Tobolski for getting me the text for this
batch of cards. I still need to fill out my collection, guys! :) And I need to figure what category to put Carl Schulte's business card under.
Oh, yeah. Speaking of cards I need to fill out my collection, I find that my only S8 Bolaar Battleship from the Allied Forces set has gone
missing. Anyone got a spare?
</p>
<p>
<u>July 28, 1999</u> Wow! I actually did something. Posted up the spoilers for the Indirigan Touring Game promos. Thanks go to
Russell Sheehan for providing the text, as I do not own any of those cards at the moment. Hint, hint. There's a few strategy bits from
various people in my mailbox still which I hope to get to soon. Amazing that there are still people out there that play. I like this game,
wish I had more people around that played. Wish the game would get revived. *Sigh*

    <li><strong>Background</strong> This section covers the background of the Far Side. All of the information here is taken from the
    printed card sets including promotional cards. It is divided into three sections:</li>

    </ul>

    <li><a href="strat.html">Decks & Empires</a> This section contains information clarifying points of confusion about each
    empire as well as tips on what goes into making an effective deck for each empire. In addition to the general strategy section,
    there are sections on deck design, rules clarifications and play tips (including card combinations for the major empires requiring
    empire-specific cards) for each empire:</li>

    <li><strong>Strategy: Theme Decks</strong> One of the more intriguing aspects of Galactic Empires deck design are the numerous
    <a href="strategy/strat-themes.html">"theme"</a> decks. Powerful or off-the-wall, they make game play very
    entertaining. Here are some of my (and others') favorites.</li>
    <ul>

        <li><a href="strategy/strat-themes.html#spy">Espionage</a></li>

        <li><a href="strategy/strat-themes.html#science">Space Academy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <li><a href="strategy/strat-single.html">Strategy: Single Cards</a> Getting the most use out of specific cards. Less-than-obvious
    uses for powerful or often-overlooked cards, combinations that enhance the effectiveness of an already powerful and the
    "Most Useless Card in Galactic Empires" survey.</li>

    <li><a href="strategy/strat-combos.html">Strategy: Card Combinations</a> A lot of the fun and most of the power in Galactic
    Empires comes not from single cards and usually not even from one or two cards, but from lots of cards working together to
    crush your <strike>enemies</strike> friends endless hours of fun can be had imagining new and amusing card combinations.
    Some of the things you might expect to find here are in <u><em>Single Cards</em></u> (above) instead.</li>

<p>
And, as always, feedback, feedback, feedback. I need feedback. Unless of course your thought is "it sucks" or some other mutation
thereof. In that case, do everybody a favor and save the bandwidth. Tell your cat instead. A <em>true</em> cat will ignore you. And be
relieved I didn't post pictures of my cats...
