<strong>Pulse Phasers:</strong> These specialized phasers require energy to be allocated to them in order to be fired. The number of
points of energy allocated are the number of separate times they may be fired in a single Weapons Fire Phase (in separate volleys).
</p>
<p>
I have not yet had a chance to play this empire. Having lots of energy so that you can power every pulse phaser the maximum number
of times would be the key to this empire. Being able to have your entire fleet target multiple opponent vessels (essentially at once) can
be very powerful.

<p>
The discussion of the <a href="../strat_c.html#clydon">Clydon Empire</a> pretty much covers anything that might be said
about the Paraloid at this point.

<p>
P.O.T. decks tend to be fairly generic. They lend themselves to most decks themes since they do not require a great deal of special
support cards. The most important thing is to have enough ammunition to power your heavy weapons (especially the shield penetration
devices). Since your ships are weighted towards heavy weapons you could go with a cheesy terrain-destruction theme.
</p>
<p>
Key cards:
<ul>
    <li><strong>C3 Time-travelling Arms Dealer <small>(promotional card)</small></strong></li>
    <li><strong>C10 Time-travelling Arms Dealer <small>(promotional card)</small></strong></li>
    <li><strong>E9 Plasma Stream Accelerator</strong>
        allows plasma streams on unit to be used as shield penetration device</li>
    <li><strong>T8 - Planet - P.O.T. Element Capital</strong>
        allows 1 plasma stream on each POT to be used as a shield penetration
        device</li>
    <li><strong>T8 Plasmatic Nebula</strong>
        plasma streams operate for 1 less ammunition each turn</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Consider these cards:
<ul>
    <li><strong>S7 Andromeda Bound Munitions Cruiser</strong></li>
    <li><strong>T4 Moon - Aldibrik Munitions Plant</strong></li>
    <li><strong>T6 System - Gorgorchok</strong></li>
</ul>

entry.

<h2 align="center"><a name="psy">Psy empires</a></h2>
<em>with suggestions by David S. Auer</em>
<p>
A psy empires is probably the most difficult deck to design. Many more support cards are in order to get your equivalent of ships - the
psy cards themselves - in play and keep them alive. Like ships, they are vulnerable to weapons fire. Unlike ships, they are also
vulnerable to all the things that afflict crew. But keep them alive long enough and they can be formidible. And remember, the damage
from a psy card is considered weapons fire <em>for all purposes</em>. That includes, damaging the Sector HQ and playing cards
which modify weapons fire or volleys.
</p>
<p>
In addition to weapons fire-modifying cards, key cards in a psy deck are anything that makes a crew card bigger. This includes all the
automaton cards as well as less-obvious things like the <strong>B7 Academy</strong> and <strong>C8 Spiritual Leader</strong> <em>(both
increase the strength of all crew in the fleet by one)</em>, <strong>M1 Party Animals</strong> <em>(increases the strength of crew by the
number of other crew at location)</em> (especially with a <strong>B3 Frat House</strong> (the strength of all crew at the house is increased by
the number of <em>other</em> crew at the frat house) and <strong>T5 Custom Planet - Galactic Trade World</strong> <em>(increases the
strength of crew at its location by two)</em>.
</p>
<p>
Because your main damage dealing cards are vulnerable to crew-afflicting things, you might consider playing with doctor cards.
However, I have not found this to be necessary in practice, as illness and injury cards are not in common use. Further, when playing
Visonic your deck is generating a large amount of research to be used with your field-employing psys. This research can easily be
funnelled into removing injury and illness cards. The only card of this type that has ever ruined my day with a psy deck are the
<strong>O5 Insanity</strong> and <strong>O9 Insanity</strong> cards.
</p>
<p>
Another card which can suck the lfie right out of a psy deck is the <strong>T3 Vacation World</strong>. For this reason, and also for
rescuing your pys as their location is blown out from under them, I recommend various types of crew transport.
</p>
<p>
There are those who insist that a good psy needs ships. I have not found it so, although it can be an interesting variation. If you do put
ships in your deck, include <strong>R/S1 Emergency Ship</strong>s.
</p>
<p>
Key cards:
<ul>
    <li><strong>A5 Greater Automaton</strong></li>
    <li><strong>R/A7 Improved Automaton</strong></li>
    <li><strong>C4 Cybersist</strong>
        all crew in the fleet no longer require points to be engaged</li>
    <li><strong>C8 Spiritual Leader</strong>
        add to the strength of all crew in fleet, allow crew to function twice</li>
    <li><strong>C10 Spiritual Leader</strong>
        add to the strength of all crew in fleet, allow crew to function twice</li>
    <li><strong>E8 Psy Relay</strong>
        allows a terrain to protect the Psy Network</li>
    <li><strong>P9 Il'ith I'karnas</strong>
        all fields in the fleet become engaged without cost; additional fields are played in the engaged position</li>
    <li><strong>T2 Psy Moon</strong>
        psys on the moon cannot be damaged by weapons fire</li>
    <li><strong>T4 Planet - Visonic Homeworld</strong>
        Visonics in the fleet ignore the first 2 points of damage each opponent volley</li>
    <li><strong>T5 Custom Planet - Galactic Trade World <small>(promotional card)</small></strong>
        five shields, adds 2 strength to crew in play on it</li>
    <li><strong>T5 Psycanti Planetismal</strong>
        Psycanti in the fleet are 2 point stronger for using psy functions</li>
    <li><strong>T10 System Mayfair System Galaxy Express 999 <small>(promotional card)</small></strong>
        ten shields, in reactions move one crew in fleet to another location</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Consider these cards:
<ul>
    <li><strong>B3 Biodome</strong></li>
    <li><strong>B3 Frat House <small>(promotional card)</small></strong></li>
    <li><strong>B6 Cloning Station</strong></li>
    <li><strong>C4 Spiritual Leader</strong></li>
    <li><strong>C5 Cybernetic Engineer</strong>
        retrieves automaton cards from discard pile</li>
    <li><strong>R/C6 Telepath</strong></li>
    <li><strong>M1 Party Animals</strong></li>
    <li><strong>M6 Time Guardian</strong></li>
