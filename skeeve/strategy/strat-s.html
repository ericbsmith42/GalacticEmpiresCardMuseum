<h2 align="center">The Scientists</h2>
<p>
This empire is discussed in the <a href="../strat_i.html#scientists">Scientists</a> section of the Indirigan Tribes entry.
</p>


<hr size="3" width="70%">
<h2 align="center"><a name="scorpead">Scorpead Dominion</a></h2>
<p>
The Scorpead have an ability to produce tremendous amounts of phaser damage. Increase the number of phasers your ships have at
every opportunity. This especially means the use of <strong>E9 Future Ship</strong> and <strong>E6 Extreme Phaser Refit</strong>. The new Indirigan
promotional tribes' flagships with the ability to fire their already-considerable phasers at units targetting them (
<a href="../promobase/promo-s.html#council">S10 Council of Six Tribe Battleship</a>,
<a href="../promobase/promo-s.html#garshain">S10 Garshain Battleship</a>,
<a href="../promobase/promo-s.html#infected">S10 Dread Savior</a>,
<a href="../promobase/promo-s.html#intrepid">S10 Intrepid Wanderer
</a>), plus a Comet of Lore, produce nice fireworks.
</p>
<p>
A well-timed <strong>O9 Catastrophic Repetition</strong> can ruin your opponents' whole day.</p>
</p>
<p>
Also consider using <a href="../strategy/strat-t.html#tranoan">Tranoans</a> as a minor empire.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Phaser Magnifier:</strong> This device allows a Scorpead unt to multiply damage done by each of its phasers. The damage done by
each phaser is multiplied by the amount of energy applied to the phaser magnifier system. The maximum amount of energy which
can be allocated to the magnifier system is indicated by the number energy point symbols. If no energy is allocated to the magnifier
system, each phaser does one point of damage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hyperspace Detonator:</strong> This system is the basis of the Scorpead heavy weapon. When ammunition points are allocated to
the detonator system, each phaser on the unit acts as a heavy weapon. Each phaser will then cause an amount of heavy weapon
damage equal to the number of ammunition points allocated to the system (up the maximum indicated by the number of ammunition
point symbols). The hyperspace detonator and phaser magnifier may not both be armed in the same turn.
</p>
<p>
Key cards:
<ul>
    <li><strong>E7 Extreme Phaser Refit <small>(promotional card)</small></strong>
        adds 3  phaser points</li>
    <li><strong>E9 Future Ship</strong>
        doubles the number of phasers</li>
    <li><strong>T7 Comet - Scorpead Comet of Lore</strong>
        one Scorpead ship in the fleet may apply its phaser magnifier to one other ship in the fleet</li>
    <li><strong>T7 Moon - Scorpead Dominated Moon</strong>
        phaser magnifiers in the fleet operate for 1 less energy</li>
</ul>
Please note that under the rules for Hyperspace Detonators (rulebook Version 2, page 27), Scorpead ships may not be fitted with
heavy weapon refits.
</p>
<h3>Card Combinations for Scorpead Fleets</h3>
<h4>Custom Scorpead Base</h4>
<em>by David S. Auer</em>
<p>
<strong>S9 Scorpead Dreadnaught</strong> + <strong>R/E10 Docking Ring</strong> + <strong>B9 Custom Base</strong><br>
Eight hyperspace detonators x 12 phasers = 96 heavy weapons damage without further modifiers.
</p>


<hr size="3" width="70%">
<h2 align="center"><a name="shonti">Shon-ti</a></h2>
<p>
The Shon-ti are allies of the Zedan. Shon-ti ships are unremarkable in every respect. Well, almost. The <strong>S4 Shon-ti Defender
Cruiser</strong> has the interesting special ability of being able to fire its three swarm bolts (if armed) in reaction to being targetted. This
is in addition to being able to fire on its own turn. Combined with their <strong>E6 Swarm Bolt Accelerator</strong>, which allows swarm bolts
to be fired an additional time each turn, we may be getting somewhere. And their special terrain, the <strong>T7 Planet - Shon-ti Swarm
Homground</strong> allows each unit have fire one swarm bolt in reaction to being targetted. They are very effective allies of the Zedan,
but I see little profit in a Shon-ti main-empire deck.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Swarm Bolts:</strong> The Shon-ti heavy weapon is armed like a standard heavy weapon. When a swarm bolt is fired it does one
point of damage to each and every valid target (not already targetted by weapons fire) in the targetted stack. Bases will still protect
terrain in the stack. Combined terrain (not each terrain card) is treated as a single target.
</p>


<hr size="3" width="70%">
<h2 align="center"><a name="dragon">Space Dragon</a></h2>
<em>with suggestions by David S. Auer</em>
<p>
The main difficulty with a Space Dragon deck is the same as an Orgon deck: with a few exceptions, your ships (dragons) are easier to
kill than those of the "normal" empires. Even your biggest, baddest D10 'blow up real good' with only ten points of damage. All of the
terrain which reduce weapon volleys against dragons even things up quite nicely. You will also probably find that the various dragons
which are immune to certain types of weapons fire tend to attract the most attention from your opponents. You can use this to your
advantage, misdirecting your opponent's forces until you set up whatever evil scheme you really had in mind.
</p>
<p>
Reserve Fleet suggestions:
<ul>
    <li><strong>D1 Scintillating Dragoness</strong></li>
    <li><strong>A5 Ancient Molting</strong></li>
    <li><strong>D1 Tending Dragoness</strong> <small>(promotional card)</small>
        doubles output of dragon terrain on which it is in play</li>
    <li><strong>T5 Dragon Cave</strong></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
With the tremendous quantity of breath weapons you'll be bringing into play you might want to consider the ultra-cheesy
terrain-destruction theme. The large number of terrain which help to protect dragons also tend to be useful with monsters. Consider
using a fairly large selection of monsters in your deck.
