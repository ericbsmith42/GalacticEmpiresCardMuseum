<h1 align="center">Theme Decks</h1>
<p>
Galactic Empires lends itself quite well to deck themes: carrier fleets, boarding party decks, spy decks and even police decks. Some
of these can be quite devastating in play but many are just fun or different. Below are some of the themes I have used and enjoyed.
</p>
<center>
<table cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width=0 border=2 frame="void" rules="cols">

    <td><a href="#artifact">Archaeology</a></td>
    <td><a href="#spy">Espionage</a></td>

<hr size="3" width="70%">
<h2 align="center"><a name="artifact">Archaeology</a></h2>
<p>
This deck is built around the large number of luck cards which are artifacts and the various ships, crew, bases and so forth which are
keyed to artifact cards. The <strong>S4 Archaeology Ship</strong> is the only card which I would consider required for this deck theme. It is
interesting to play this deck theme using several of the agenda cards, specifically <strong>G5 Archaeology</strong> and, since your deck will
probably be generating a large amount of research, <strong>G6 Ancient Studies</strong>. The latter works best when there are a number of
installations in the deck, so consider using the <a href="#comedy">Comedy Club Network</a> as your primary empire.
</p>
<p>
Key cards:
<ul>
    <li><strong>B3 Forgotten Ruins</strong></li>
    <li><strong>C5 Archaeologist <small>(promotional card)</small></strong>
        allows you to use artifacts in play in any fleet</li>
    <li><strong>C10 Scholar</strong></li>
    <li><strong>G5 Archaeology</strong></li>
    <li><strong>L1 - Artifactor - Collector Toy <small>(promotional card)</small></strong></li>
    <li><strong>L3 Artifact - Gauntlet of Time</strong></li>
    <li><strong>L6 Artifact - Sceptre of Time</strong>
        allows extra card plays, draws or reserve fleet swaps</li>
    <li><strong>L6 Artifact - Spiritual Symbol</strong>
        allows all crew in the fleet to generate one research point</li>
    <li><strong>L7 Alien Artifact</strong>
        allows you to draw three cards</li>
    <li><strong>L7 Artifact - Star Gate</strong>
        allows one extra card play</li>
    <li><strong>L9 Artifact - Empire Constitution</strong>
        increases weapons volleys from main empire ship and allows free card plays</li>
</ul>
</p>


<hr size="3" width="70%">
<h2 align="center"><a name="spy">Espionage</a></h2>
An espionage deck is used to keep tabs on the cards your opponents have in hand. This lets you plan your actions with an eye towards
guarding against what they may be able to do as a reaction. Zedan is a natural empire for the espionage theme. Use your spys and add
in a few assassins and other crew-attacking cards and you can really limit your opponent's options. Is deadly against the ol' Noble and
Filarian decks. Also somewhat susceptible to Infestation itself.
<p>
Key cards:
<ul>
    <li><strong>R/C12 Cryptologist</strong></li>
    <li><strong>C4 Intelligence Officer</strong></li>
    <li><strong>R/C4 Spy</strong></li>
    <li><strong>R/C6 Spy</strong></li>
    <li><strong>R/C9 Master Spy</strong></li>
    <li><strong>E2 Crystalline Detection Matrix</strong></li>
    <li><strong>various Spy Ships</strong></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This is also one of the themes that lends itself to certain cards that don't work directly with the deck's main function, but seem to lend
themselves to the "Espionage" concept. Consider these cards:
<ul>
    <li><strong>O5 Political Upheaval</strong></li>
    <li><strong>O8 Planetary Revolt</strong></li>
</ul>
All of the various discard effect cards also work well in these decks, since you have a chance to look at your opponent's hand. If you
have viewed cards from your opponent's hand you can choose which cards to discard with most of the discard effects. See the
<a href="../cardbase/cardbase.html#discard">card database</a> for a list of discard effect cards.

<h2 align="center"><a name="eternal">Eternal Warrior</a></h2>
<em>by Bob Peterson</em>
<p>
This deck design requires a large reserve fleet or a lot of luck to guarantee it does its trick. Begin with the <strtong>R/C6 Time Assault Teams</strong>,
<strong>T4 Nrutos</strtong>, <strrong>R/O3 Instant Reaction</strong>, and a <strong>R/C6 Damage Control Team</strong> in your reserve fleet.
Get the Time Assault Teams into your hand as fast as possible and play them as reactions, leaving them on Nrutos. Then shoot, gouge, discard or
whatever to return Nrutos and its crew to your hand. The deck should also have plenty of shuttles for reactionary damage and to ground and return
to hand your Damage Control Teams. This strategy works well with the J'xar.
<p>
Key cards:
<ul>
    <li><strong>R/C6 Damage Control Team</strong></li>
    <li><strong>R/C6 Time Assault Team</strong></li>
    <li><strong>R/O3 Instant Reaction</strong></li>
    <li><strong>T4 Nrutos</strong></li>
    <li>All types of shuttles</li>
</ul>
</p>


<hr size="3" width="70%">
<h2 align="center"><a name="bee">"Exploding Bees"</a></h2>
<p>
The "Exploding Bee" deck is based around shuttles, fighters and the <strong>E4 Shuttle Bomb</strong> card. The key play of the deck is
shuttle or fighter in reaction to weapons fire, getting the shuttle/fighter in play without consuming a card play. On your next turn use a
shuttle bomb on the shuttle/fighter. With the larger fighters this can do significant amounts of damage to opponent ships. If you blow up
one of the empire-specific fighters from Personas or Galactic Invaders the tactic works even better, since the fighter returns to your hand
rather than being discarded. Then use a <strong>B8 Manufacturing Plant</strong> to retrieve the E4 Shuttle Bomb...
</p>
<p>
This strategy works best in a deck which has been designed as a carrier fleet, <em>i.e.</em> contains a number of carrier ships in support
of its shuttles/fighters. This way, a shuttle/fighter can be played in reaction and fire during your weapons fire phase repeatedly until you
are able use a shuttle bomb.
</p>
<p>
Key cards:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fighters</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Shuttles</strong></li>
    <li><strong>B8 Manufacturing Plant</strong></li>
    <li><strong>E4 Shuttle Bomb</strong></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Consider these cards:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Carriers</strong></li>
</ul>
</p>


<hr size="3" width="70%">
<h2 align="center"><a name="bee">Space Academy</a></h2>
<p>
This is a deck based around research production and monsters. The critical cards are the three promotional bases: <strong>B6 Science
Academy</strong>, <strong>B7 Science Academy</strong> and <strong>B10 Science Academy</strong> and each of the science officers:
<strong>R/C1 Science officer</strong>, <strong>R/C2 Science Officer</strong>, <strong>R/C4 Science Officer</strong> and <strong>R/C7 Science Officer</strong>.
This deck has a lot in common with the <a href="#artifact">Archaeology</a> deck described above.
