<h2 align="center"><a name="setup">Setup</a></h2>

<P>Use a board with large (6 inch) hexes, so that a stack
can be placed in each easily. Mix up a bunch of terrain
(mostly T1-T2; it will add up quickly; try not to use any
terrain that generates more than 2 of any point type), and
maybe some installations, hazards, monsters, and null cards
(cards that will be considered blank and removed if flipped
over). Deal one to each space face down. If possible, have a
gamemaster determine what the face down cards are (and
possibly put stacks of cards in each hex), and place stars
face up. Use small terrain, as getting a big terrain early
can throw the game balance way off. In playtesting one
player got a planet that made 3 economy per turn, which he
used to build a Fleet Freighter, and then a tug, resulting
in a production of 15 economy per turn from a single
terrain. Larger terrain might be placed in the center of the
map so that it is not discovered until later in the game.
Alternate setups are possible. Each player may have control
over setting up their own starting territory using a certain
number and type of cards (5 T1s, 3 T2s, and a T3; none
producing more than one economy each).</P>

<P>Each player starts with a single S1 patrol ship (these
have no engagement cost, which is essential since no one has
any terrain yet; also they return to the player's hand, so
no one will be eliminated from the game totally) that enters
along an edge. Optionally, each player may begin with a
single terrain and one population unit instead. It is
suggested that each player get an identical T2 terrain that
produces one supply and one energy.</P>


<hr size="3" width="70%">
<h2 align="center"><a name="mechanics">Game Mechanics</a></h2>

<P><strong>Game Phases:</strong> Allocation of points and engagement
occurs at the beginning of each turn. Then players acquire
cards. Engaged ships may then be moved one hex in any
direction. The last three phases are card play phase A,
weapons fire, and card play phase B.</P>

<P><strong>Ship movement:</strong> Players may move any ship one hex
in the movement/allocation phase, or may move it on or off
of terrain. Flip over any face down cards in that hex, and
consider any card that could be played on a ship to be
played on the first ship that enters that hex (hazards,
monsters, etc.). The gamemaster (if one is used) or the
player to the left of the player whose turn it is gets to
make any decisions about how uncontrolled cards in that hex
behave. An optional rule is that another player gets a free
card play against the ship that first enters a new hex.
Starting with the player to the left, and going clockwise
around the table, the first player who wants to can play a
hazard, monster, luck, or occurence card in that hex.</P>

<P><strong>Weapons fire:</strong> Weapons may be fired at any valid
targets within the same hex. All units capable of weapons
fire within a hex occupied by a target owned by the current
player are allowed to fire at any target within that hex,
regardless of whose turn it is. Starting with the player to
the left of the current player, and continuing in a
clockwise direction, each player in a hex declares all
weapons volleys within that hex. The current player declares
weapons fire last. Effects of weapons fire are then resolved
simultaneously. Cards that get to fire weapons in reaction
must be handled differently under these rules. These cards
resolve the effects of weapon fire before other cards get to
fire. For example, player A moves a unit into player B's
hex. Player B declares weapons fire, then player A, then B
plays 2 R/E7 Heavy Fighters in reaction. Player A's ship is
destroyed by the fighters and no further weapons fire occurs
due to lack of viable targets. Weapons fire is resolved one
hex at a time for each hex that the current player occupies
which contains a legal target. Each player who could fire at
a target belonging to the current player gets an opportunity
to do so, regardless of whether the current player wishes to
have combat or not. The current player has control over the
order in which hexes are dealt with.</P>

<P><strong>Heavy weapons:</strong> Since the terrain mix is limited,
it may drastically hinder the playability of the game to
allow heavy weapons to damage terrain. Instead, heavy
weapons may be used to target unprotected population units
on a terrain. Each point of heavy weapons fire may be used
to remove one population unit.</P>

<P><strong>Population:</strong> Population tokens are considered C1
Crew cards with special restrictions and functions.
Population are C1 units in all other regards, and may be
eliminated by boarding parties, armed with Ability cards,
etc. Other crew cards do not count as population. The most
important function of population tokens is that they allow
the controlling player to control the terrain that they are
on if the majority of population tokens on that terrain
belong to that player.</P>

<P>Terrain and installations may carry a number of
population up to their current strength. Reductions in
strengaa are accompanied by the immediate destruction of
enough population to bring the total down to its maximum
(attacker's choice). Ships and bases up to strength 4 may
only carry one population. Ships and bases up to strength 8
may carry up to 2 population. Ships and bases of strength 9
or 10 may carry up to 3 population tokens. Bases on terrain
may be considered to be a single location, with all
population units on the terrain. For example, a B1 on a T1
allows the player to have 2 population units on that
terrain. If either the terrain or the base is destroyed, the
player may place the population on the surviving card, up to
its capacity.</P>

<P>If you are playing with a setup scenario where each
player starts with a populated terrain, players may be
eliminated from the game by losing all of their population.
Otherwise, if a player has no population units, that player
may start (or restart) his or her empire by placing a
population unit upon a single terrain that one of his or her
ships shares a hex with. At the beginning of the turn, add
one population token to each location (up to maximum capacity)
that contains at least one population token owned by the
current player, and that generates supply, economy, or
energy.</P>

<P>Population units may not move in reaction. Moving a
single population unit from one location to another occupies
the card used to move it for the entire turn, such that it
cannot be used for anything else that turn. For example,
three R/E2 transporters would be needed to move 3 population
units onto a ship in the same hex. Population units may not
be transported outside of the hex that they are in, except
by ship movement.</P>

<P><strong>Dragons/Orgons:</strong> Population units are D1 Dragon
Hatchlings or D1 Orgon Buds that can be combined and
separated from other dragons, but cannot move on their own
and have no other statistics (damage, etc.). Since they are
D units, they may be standard targets of weapons fire. They
may also receive the benefits of Dragon Holes, provided they
are within the area of effect of that terrain (see below).
Each unit that combines or separates consumes a card play.
When separating, damage may be divided among units in any
way desired, so long as no more damage is allocated to a
unit than the unit has strength. For example, a player has a
D6 dragon combined with 2 population units. The player
allocates 2 points of damage to the population units upon
separating from them, consuming 2 card plays and destroying
both population units. A Dragon/Orgon player may never play
or use equipment, crew, ships, or bases. However, a Dragon
(or Orgon) card acts like a population unit for the purpose
of determining control of terrain. For example, player A,
with 5 population counters on a terrain, would lose control
of that terrain when player B lands a D7 Dragon on that
terrain.</P>

<P><strong>Card play:</strong> Cards that must be deployed into or on
your fleet can only be played in hexes where you control a
card. Cards played on or against an opponent fleet may be
played anywhere. If a player controls no locations, cards
may be deployed into the map hex that the player started in.
Cards which are deployed into your fleet must be deployed at
a location where their purchase cost may have been paid (see
lines of supply and getting cards). This is calculated
independently of other purchases and engagement costs (so,
if a location could receive 2 supply and 2 energy maximum,
any number of S2 ships could be played to that location, up
to the maximum playable cards per turn, even if those points
were used to engage a ship).</P>

<P><strong>Area of effect:</strong> Cards played into or on your fleet
may only effect the hex they are in. This includes weapons
fire, transportation of crew, equipment effects, etc. Cards
played against a card or cards may only affect a single hex.
Cards played against a fleet also affect hexes adjacent to a
hex that is declared to be the origin of the card play.
Cards that say they move from one location to another
(Juggernauts, etc.) may move one hex during the turn of the
player whose turn that card entered play during.</P>

<P><strong>Lines of supply:</strong> Any card which can generate or
modify supply, energy, or economy (but not ammunition)
points can also be used to extend the line of supply.
Supply, energy, economy and ammunition points generated in
the line of contiguous units may be used as if they were
generated at any point upon that line. For example, a player
has a T5 Planet, then next to it a S1 Fleet Freighter
(engaged with points from the planet), and next to that
another S1 Fleet Freighter, and next to that a S4 Ship that
is also receiving points from the original planet. If the
middle S1 ship were destroyed, then the S4 ship would not be
able to get engagement points, and would just float in space
until the line of supply was restored (since ships that
cannot engage cannot move).</P>

<P><strong>Terrain:</strong> Terrain is controlled by (part of the
fleet of) the player who has the majority of population on
it. If no player has a majority, then the terrain generates
no points for anyone and is uncontrolled. Points and effects
generated by a terrain may be used within that hex and the
hexes adjacent. Supply, energy, economy, and ammunition
points may be transported through a line of supply (see
rules below), but repair and research may not be
transported.</P>

<P><strong>Point output modifiers:</strong> Since players have control
over the cards that they can acquire, allowing the
unrestricted use of point output modifiers may be
unbalancing. It is suggested that players agree that only
one positive or multiplicative modifier may be applied by a
player to a single location. Therefore, a player may not use
both a Freighter's +3 economy and a Tug's x3 economy, but
instead must choose which to apply during that turn. Cards
that contribute a point output modifier may not be moved for
the duration of that turn.</P>

<P><strong>Installations:</strong> Installations are uncontrolled
until a player has crew in play on the installation with a
total strength that is greater than the strength of the
installation. Essentially the player must overcome the
native crew complement of the installation. The player with
the greatest total strength of crew above the minimum
required gains control of the installation.</P>

<P><strong>Psys:</strong> Psy effects are treated like weapons fire,
and may only affect the hex which contains the Psy. Fields
affect the same area as terrain, and so may be used in any
adjacent hex. Optional rule: fields may be used along a
line-of-psy, which works in a way similar to a line of
supply. A Psy card may use any field which is either
adjacent, or is connected to the Psy by a contiguous line of
Psy cards. For example, hex 1 contains a Field, hex 2
contains a P1, hex 3 contains a P3, and hex 4 contains the
P7 Psy who wishes to utilize the field in hex 1.</P>


<hr size="3" width="70%">
<h2 align="center"><a name="cardaq">Card Acquisition</a></h2>

<P>Although it is possible to play the game using normal
decks and rules for drawing cards randomly, the following
set of rules is suggested:</P>

<P><strong>Getting cards:</strong> A point system is used to buy
cards, which must be paid at one time during the allocation
phase. A player may purchase any card which is available to
him or her based on the deck construction rules you are
using. Costs are as follows:</P>


<UL>

<LI><strong>Ships/Bases/Psys/Dragons:</strong> Supply and Energy equal
to strength (i.e., an S4 would cost 4 Energy and 4 Supply)</LI>

<LI><strong>Equipment:</strong> Energy equal to strength</LI>

<LI><strong>Crew:</strong> Supply equal to strength</LI>

<LI><strong>Others:</strong> Research equal to strength</LI>

</UL>

<P>Cards are acquired after point allocation. The maximum
number of cards drawn is as normal, based on hand size and
modifying cards, but a player need not draw cards if he or
she does not want to or is unable to pay for them. It is
assumed that players will be honest about their purchases.
If you wish, you may play that players must show their
purchases.</P>


<hr size="3" width="70%">
<h2 align="center"><a name="decks">Deck Construction</a></h2>

<P>Although traditional rules may be used (creating
monstrous decks of thousands of cards), the suggested method
is as follows: Decks are made of the main empire and generic
ships, dragons, bases, equipment, crew, psys, and fields.
Advantages that allow the use of foreign/exclusive
technology allow the addition of those cards to the deck.
Cards of other types are allowed only if they meet one of
the following criteria: they are an empire-specific card or
they are used in a special system of an empire specific card
(i.e., manuever cards are used by manuevering systems on
Gekonauak ships). You may decide that other cards are legit
to use in decks (certain terrain, such as artificial moons,
etc.). Certain cards have usefulness way out of proportion
to cost, such as ships that require no engagment costs
(patrol ships). You may wish to limit the number of those in
each player's deck.</P>

<P>You may further wish to limit the size of decks with
other contruction rules. Decks may be contructed only from
'tracks' of cards containing one card of each type leading
up to the highest value card of that type in that track. For
example, if you want to have 3 E9 cards, you must have 3 E
cards or each lower value. A maximum number of cards may be
specified per deck (for example, 60), or a total number of
points (for example, 200).</P>

<P>Another option is to play civilization style, where each
player owns a deck containing only empire-specific cards.
All other cards are placed in a central area which all
players purchase cards from. A player can be screwed by not
buying essential cards before the other players. You could
alternately do a draft of these cards before the game
starts, where each player takes turns picking out cards to
use in their deck.</P>

<P>Several other card sources are suggested:</P>

<UL>

<LI><strong>Mystery deck:</strong> A deck of miscellaneous cards
(mostly luck and occurences) is shuffled and placed face
down in a central area. It costs three research points for
each card draw, regardless of what card is drawn.

<LI><strong>Mercenary deck:</strong> This face-down shuffled central
deck consists of minor empire cards. The player allocates a
number of economy points (at least one) to draw a card. The
player gets to keep the card if its strength is equal to or
lower than the number of points allocated. Otherwise the
card is discarded (the player is only paying the mercenary
enough to stay out of the war).

<LI><strong>Monster deck:</strong> This optional face-down shuffled
central deck consists of monsters (hostile and beneficial),
and possibly hazards, luck, occurences, etc. Whenever a
player enters a new hex (with a face down card in it), a
card is drawn from this deck and played on the ship or the
hex it entered (whichever is specified by the card). The
gamemaster or player to the left of the current player
determines the effects. Use of this deck may make
exploration extremely dangerous, making science officers
essential. If you do not want to place terrain onto the map
in advance, you may just shuffle all terrain, hazards, and
installations into this deck, and draw a card to be put into
the hex for the first time that that hex is entered.

</UL>


<hr size="3" width="70%">
<h2 align="center"><a name="victory">Victory Conditions</a></h2>

<P>The player with the most population in play at the end of
the game wins. The end of the game may be determined by a
set period of time or by a target population level (25 is
suggested, or more if starting planets or larger terrain are
used). Optionally, alternate victory conditions may be used.
These could be in addition to the main condition, or instead
of it. Each player may choose a condition, may have a
condition randomly assigned, or may have it linked to a
specific empire. Finally, this alternate condition may
either be known to all players or may be kept secret.
Several are suggested here for playtesting:</P>


<UL>

<LI><strong>Teritorial expansion:</strong> Control X terrain</LI>

<LI><strong>Sector expansion:</strong> Build a line of supply from one
map edge to another</LI>

<LI><strong>Economic prosperity:</strong> Generate X economy each turn</LI>

<LI><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Generate X research each turn</LI>

<LI><strong>Standard of living:</strong> Generate X of each type of
point (supply, economy, energy, and research) for each
population unit each turn</LI>

<LI><strong>Military superiority:</strong> Control a fleet with a
total ship strength of X</LI>

<LI><strong>Exploration:</strong> Explore (flip over the cards in) X
hexes</LI>

<LI><strong>Glorious warfare:</strong> Win X battles (destroy all
units in location)</LI>

<LI><strong>Conquest:</strong> Settle X planets that were previously
controlled by others</LI>

<LI><strong>Isolation:</strong> Eliminate all opposing units from a
certain section of the map</LI>

<LI><strong>Genocide:</strong> Eliminate all units of X opposing
players (difficult)</LI>

<LI><strong>Find a new homeworld:</strong> Settle to full capacity a
certain terrain</LI>

<LI><strong>Metropolis:</strong> Have X population occupy a single hex
(building bases, etc.)</LI>

</UL>

<P>Another option is to have some players begin the game
with a large number of units, population, and terrain. Their
victory condition might be have maintained their empire
(retain all terrain) at game end (in turns or a time limit).
Or they might have as their victory condition that they
control every controlled terrain after several turns have
passed (the evil empire).</P>


<hr size="3" width="70%">
<h2 align="center"><a name="comments">General Comments</a></h2>

<P>The feel of this game is quite different from the feel of
traditional Galactic Empires games. I believe it captures a
traditional sci-fi mood of exploration and technology
better. Players may find themselves setting up remote
research bases to deal with a problem, and may develop
fronts to deal with aggressors. It also radically changes
the value of certain types of cards. Some have become
essential (transporters, shuttles), and others are really
useful (Spy Technicians, CFOs and other cards that store
points). Bases become much more important, and
fighters/shuttles played in reaction become instrumental in
determining battle outcomes by eliminating units before they
have a chance to fire. As always happen when adapting card
games to new rules structures, many cards make no sense
within this play structure and other cards may be extremely
limited in function.</P>
